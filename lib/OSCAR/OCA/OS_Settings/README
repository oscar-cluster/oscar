Each of the files in this directory are configuration files. They
match up with distribution names as reported from OS_Detect.  There
is a default file, which is the baseline settings.  

OS_Settings.pm reads from general through to specific.  This means that
it will read and use the most specific setting, even if the setting exists
in a "higher" config.  

All configuration options should exist in the default file.

The format of the file is as such:

nfs_package=nfs

with nfs_package being the configuration option name, and nfs being the
value.
