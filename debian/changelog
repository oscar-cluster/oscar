oscar (5.1~svn20070822-0gv1) stable; urgency=low

  * New upstream development release 
  * Include few new packages needed my OPKGC, currently empty: oscar-base,
    oscae-base-client, oscar-base-server.
  * Remove all binary packages when creating the Debian packages (they are
    not needed).
  * Install OSCAR libs into /usr/lib/perl5/OSCAR/ instead of /opt/oscar/libs.
  * Split up OSCAR into different Debian packages: liboscar, oscar-bin, and
    oscar.
  * Add a dependency to c-shell | tcsh for the oscar Debian package.
  * Relocate the OSCAR logo into /usr/share/oscar/images. A patch has been
    created to update the OSCAR code for that.
  * Relocate part of the code in the share directory into /usr/share/oscar.
    Right now, package_sets, schemas, and machine_sets have been relocated.
