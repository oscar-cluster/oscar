This is the macinfo2sis program.  It is designed to take an old style
MAC.info file (circa OSCAR 1.1) and insert that information into
the SIS database for OSCAR > 1.2.

 Usage:  macinfo2sis MAC.info

The MAC.info file has the following expected format:

node001 00:11:22:33:44:55
node002 11:11:22:33:33:44
...

This program will attempt to add all the information to the database.
It will complain everytime a node update can not be made.

The exit code is the number of failed updates, not to exceed 250.

END
