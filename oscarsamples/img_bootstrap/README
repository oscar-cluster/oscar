The postinstall and cleanup files are processed respectively when bootstrapping an image and after image is built.

The file format is the same for both .bootstrap or .cleanup

- Empty lines (or with only spaces or tabs) are ignored

- # character is for comments. everything after this char is ignored. (space
    or tabs before # are also ignored)

- Commands:
        - bind <host mountpoint>
          => Mount the host mountpoint using -o bind in the image. Created the
             mountpoint in the image if needed.
             Example: "bind /dev" will mount /dev in the image

        - del <space separated file list with wildcards>
          => remove recursively the files or directories.

        - mkpath <absolute path in the image>
          => Creates the path in the image.
             Example: "mkpath /var/lib/yum" will create $imagepath/var/lib/yum
             Note: permission/owner canot be set here as passwd file does not
                   exist yet in the image

        - pkgs <space separated list of pacakges to install>
          => Installs the packages and dependancies into the image.
             In case of multiple instance of pkg comands, multiple install
             instances will be done (in order)
             Note: on rpm system, packages can be also "capabilities" like
             'perl(File::Path)'. In that case, simple quotes must be used
             around the "capabilities".

        - post <scriptname>
          => Runs the script after everything is processed.
          => Multiple post can be specified. They will be processed
             in the same order they've been decrared.
          => Path can be relative to this directory or absolute.

        - pre <scriptname>
          => Runs the script before doing everything else.
          => Multiple pre can be specified. They will be processed
             in the same order they've been decrared.
          => Path can be relative to this directory or absolute.

        - unbind <mount_point>
          => unmounts $imagepath/mount_point

- Processing order:
    - pre
    - mkpath
    - del
    - bind
    - unbind
    - pkgs
    - post
