OSCAR web spaces are splitted between 3 engines: trac, Drupal and dokuwiki. This leads to issues regarding:
 * user rights: each user must have 3 accounts
 * ergonomics for users: each engine has its proper stylesheet
 * ergonomics for developpers: links betweem these spaces are not easy to do

In order to centralize these engine into one, we have to define our needs. Please put in this page needs regarding web spaces. Then, we will be able to choose one engine.
