The OSCAR project is currently accepting submissions to the Google Summer of Code 2009 effort.  Applications for mentoring organizations are due March 12, so the bulk of the ideas will need to be posted by that time.

We have had a good success rate so far, though with the number of organizations accepted going up the number of projects per organization has gone down a bit.

Please keep in mind these projects should be suitable for students working full time from May 23, 2009 until Aug 17, 2009.

[GSOC 2009 Project Timeline](http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2009/faqs.html#0_1_timeline_5354032302481437_) is available on the link.  I would post previous project idea pages but those appear to have been lost in the move to Trac.

Current list of project hooks:

 * System partition: extend the existing core mechanisms for the definition of system partitions (e.g., meta-data server versus data server versus compute nodes).

 * Support of XtreemOS as a Grid computing solution: http://www.xtreemos.org/

 * Support of the Kerrighed single system image operating system: http://www.kerrighed.org/

 * BLCR support built in.

 * Infiniband config/management - This would obviously require the student to have access to Infiniband hardware.

 * Parallel file system support (Lustre,etc) - For a clean implementation, this would require system partitioning which is not available yet.

 * Implementation of a automatic testing solution for OSCAR: automatic execution of unit tests with developer notifications via emails; testing based on virtual machines (automatic deployment of virtual machines).

 * Update and extension of the current OSCAR graphical interfaces: it includes the perl-Qt/perl-Tk main OSCAR GUI and the webORM tool (currently developed in PHP).
