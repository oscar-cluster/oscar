## How to get help ?

Having problems building a cluster with OSCAR?  We are here to help!  However, please make sure that you have done the following steps first:

 * [Google](http://www.google.com) the error message
 * Check the OSCAR [FAQ](faq)
 * Read the OSCAR [User Documentation](http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/wiki)
 * Check the [oscar-users](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=oscar-users) and [oscar-devel](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=oscar-devel) mailing-lists archives.  Searching through the archives usually brings up solutions to common problems.
 * For SIS (imaging) related questions, also search the [sisuite-users](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=sisuite-users) mailing-list archives.
 * If after going through the above steps, and you did not find a solution to your problem, feel free to email us at the [oscar-users](mailto:oscar-users@lists.sourceforge.net) mailing list. Please be verbose about your problem and provide us with the following:
   * OSCAR version (eg. 4.2)
   * Linux Distribution and version (eg. Fedora Core 2)
   * Hardware type (eg. x86, ia64, x86_64)
   * Step you are encountering problem (eg. Step 4. Image Creation Step)
   * oscarinstall.log (located in /opt/oscar)
   * [typescript](faq#typescript) of installation
   * A list of third-party packages you may have downloaded from OPD and selected to be installed
   * Any other error messages

For `oscarinstall.log` and/or typescript, please consider using [pastebin](http://www.pastebin.ca) and simply pasting the referencing URL in your email.
