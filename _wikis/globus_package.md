High Throughput Computing -- Condor

Clusters,Grid and high throughput computing projects(condor) are projects that help setting up computing infrastructures which are of importance. Clusters ,Beowulf, used to be isolated from other emerging technologies like Grid because of many reasons importantly ease of deployment and seamless integration.

Grid software like globus have inherent support for clusters and can be used easily with same grid interface. Today many deployments specially in University there exists mixed environments.
