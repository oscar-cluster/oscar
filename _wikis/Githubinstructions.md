## How to use OSCAR Github repository ?

Before you begin, it is strongly recommended that you take a few moments to look over the github guide line [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/).  It is a valuable resource whether you are a long time programmer or just getting started.

The OSCAR Github Code Repository supports anonymous cloning. However, to commit your code in, you will need to create a github account and join [our project](https://github.com/oscar-cluster/).  To create a github account, please refer to the [link](https://github.com/join). To request for an access to the oscar-cluster project, please email us at [oscar-devel](mailto:oscar-devel@lists.sourceforge.net).

You will need a [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone our codes.

Let's try to check codes out...

For cloning the oscar github repository, the command is:

 * By using SSH

     ```
    % git clone git@github.com:oscar-cluster/oscar.git
     ```
 * By using HTTPS

     ```
    % git clone https://github.com/oscar-cluster/oscar.git
     ```

    
 * Previous versions are available [here](https://github.com/oscar-cluster/tags).
    After you have successfully checked the code out, to install OSCAR, please refer to the [install guide](quick_start_guide_for_rhel).
