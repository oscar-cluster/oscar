# WebORM

WebORM is a web-based tool for the creation and the management of OSCAR repositories, i.e., repositories that host binary packages needed by OSCAR.

The goal of the project is to provide a tool enabling:
  * the upload of binary packages without the need of creating UNIX accounts on the system,
  * the management of repositories on machines that only open the port 80 (no ssh and more important no rsync server); which is very important in "secured environments",
  * the deletion of binary packages from a given repository, i.e., for a given Linux distribution.
