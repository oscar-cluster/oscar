# OSCAR Architecture

This is a description of the OSCAR architecture. This architecture is used as specification for all implementation. The modification of the architecture has to be approved by the majority of OSCAR developers.
Note that the current version of this document is NOT the final version, discussions are still active for the specification of the OSCAR architecture.

The main OSCAR "components" are ORM, [ODA](wiki/DevODA), Configurator, Selector, [Packman](wiki/DevPackman), and the user interfaces.

The Figure [1](http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/attachmentwiki/architecture/architecture.svg) describes gives an overview of the global architecture.
