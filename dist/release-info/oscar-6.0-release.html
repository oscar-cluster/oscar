<title>OSCAR 6.0 High Performance Computing Cluster Building Toolkit Released</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The OSCAR working group has released a new version of the Open Source Cluster
Application Resources (OSCAR) toolkit, OSCAR 6.0.
</p>

<p>
OSCAR is a software package that supports the use of high-performance
computing by reducing the work of cluster configuration, installation,
operation, and management. The infrastructure underlying OSCAR 6.0 has been
completely reworked to include smart package managers, yum based image
building and package installs, easier client updating by using a repository
based approach, and optimized start ups to reduce build time. Another long
anticipated feature added in 6.0 is the ability to support multiple Linux
distributions and architectures on the same cluster.
</p>

<p>
Many other improvements to the OSCAR infrastructure, including better 
OSCAR bootstrapping and an architecture even more modular. This version also
fully supports on-line repositories for the creation of images and system
management. No time is wasted anymore downloading packages for installation.
OSCAR is also now installed directly on the system and not anymore in /opt.
This allows a better integration with other tools and ease the support of
different Linu distribution (it deeply helps the support of Debian based
systems).
</p>

<p>
OSCAR 6.0 has been fully tested for use with both x86 processors and x86_64
processors under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 and clone Linux distributions.
OSCAR-6.0 also provides an experimental support of Debian support on both
x86 and x86_64 architectures, including Debian 4 and Ubuntu 8.04. The 
experimental support means that only OSCAR core is currently supported, it is
not currently possible to support included or third-party OSCAR packages. As
a result, only clusters with a very basic configuration can be deployed when
using OSCAR-6.0 on Debian based systems.
</p>

<p>
OSCAR-6.0 version is not necessarily suitable for production. OSCAR-6.0 is 
actually very similar to KDE-4.0: this version is not necessarily "designed"
for the users who need all the capabilities traditionally shipped with OSCAR,
but this is a good new framework to include and develop new capabilities and
move forward.
</p>

OSCAR 6.0, previous OSCAR versions, and additional information about the
OSCAR project are available from the OSCAR web site:

</p>

<p>
The OSCAR working group is a consortium of industry, academic and research
participants.  Orginizations who contributed to OSCAR 6.0 include 
Revolution Linux, Bald Guy Software, Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre,
NEC HPC Europe, IBM, Intel, Indiana University, Louisiana Tech University,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the University of Texas Health 
Science Center San Antonio, the Institut National de Recherche en 
Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA), and KerLabs. OSCAR is the product of 
the OSCAR working group of the Open Cluster Group (OCG). OCG is dedicated to 
making cluster computing practical. The OCG and its subgroups are open to all.
