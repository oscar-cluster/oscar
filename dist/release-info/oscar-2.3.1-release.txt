======================

OAK RIDGE, Tenn., October 6, 2003 -- The OSCAR working group  has  release
version 2.3.1 of the Open Source  Cluster  Application	Resources  (OSCAR)
toolkit.

The OSCAR toolkit is used to build, configure and  manage  clusters.   Its
primary objective is to make use of  "best	practices"	for  Cluster  High
Performance Computing (HPC).  OSCAR enables a user to setup  and  maintain
a cluster with the same software typically found on  HPC  Clusters,  while
greatly reducing the complexity  of  the  installation	and  configuration
process.

This release has fully tested support for Red Hat 8.0,	9.0  and  Mandrake
9.0.  The underlying installation tool, System Installation  Suite	(SIS),
was updated to include a new release of  SystemImager.	 The  SystemImager
tool now  provides	multicast  installation  capabilities.	 The  Cluster,
Command and Control (C3)  tool	have  also	been  updated  to  the	latest
scalability  release  4.0.

In addition to these build	system	enhancements,  a  new  graphical  user
interface was added to the OSCAR Package Downloader (OPD).	This  addition
to the OSCAR wizard enables a user to download	additional	packages  from
on-line repositories prior to the cluster install.	Also, portions of  the
wizard's appearance have been improved by using the Qt windowing  toolkit.

The OSCAR packaging API has been  enhanced	for  improved  expressiveness.
Package authors can more easily convey what distribution and  architecture
their package supports.  

This release includes the new LAM/MPI 7.0.	There  are	also  several  new
OPD-able packages available, including: Myrinet, PVFS, and Clumon.	 These
packages can be obtained at the start of the install now via the GUI based
OPD and  installed	along  with  the  directly	included  packages.   This
release

This release support IA32 systems.	Those seeking IA64 support should  use
version 2.2.1 of OSCAR for now.  These releases,  as  well	as	additional
information are available at the OSCAR project page:
