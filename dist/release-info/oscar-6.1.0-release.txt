The OSCAR working group has released a new version of the Open Source Cluster
Application Resources (OSCAR) toolkit, OSCAR 6.1.0.

OSCAR is a software package that supports the use of high-performance
computing by reducing the work of cluster configuration, installation,
operation, and management.

OSCAR 6.1.0 has been tested for use with both x86 processors and x86_64
processors under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 and clone Linux distributions.
OSCAR-6.1.0 also provides a support of Debian support on both x86_64
architectures, including Debian 5 and Ubuntu 10.04.

OSCAR 6.1.0, previous OSCAR versions, and additional information about the
OSCAR project are available from the OSCAR web site:
   
         http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/
   
The OSCAR working group is a consortium of industry, academic and research
participants.  Organizations who contributed to OSCAR 6.1.0 include 
Revolution Linux, Bald Guy Software, Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre,
NEC HPC Europe, IBM, Intel, Indiana University, Louisiana Tech University,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the University of Texas Health 
Science Center San Antonio, the Institut National de Recherche en 
Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA), and KerLabs. OSCAR is the product of 
the OSCAR working group of the Open Cluster Group (OCG). OCG is dedicated to 
making cluster computing practical. The OCG and its subgroups are open to all.
