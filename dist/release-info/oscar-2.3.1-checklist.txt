# NOTE: Any postings to "neutral" sites, e.g., oscar.sf.net, should
#  not contain the org specific head/footers.  For example the 
#  opening 'OAK RIDGE, Tenn...' blurb should be cut, as should the
#  closing, 'ORNL is a Dept. of Energy...'.
#
#  However, on the 2.3.1 PR's, I only included the ORNL blurb 
#  with HPCwire & SuperComputing Online.
#  
#

#  NOTE, make sure to use the correct acronym for NCSA in the
#  press release itself.  The one used w/ 2.2.1 (and others)
#  is wrong, using "... Alliance".  The correct version is
#  "National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)"
