<p>
OAK RIDGE, Tenn., October 7, 2003 -- The OSCAR working group has  released
a new version of the Open Source  Cluster  Application  Resources  (OSCAR)
toolkit, OSCAR 2.3.1.

<p>
OSCAR is a software package that  supports  the  use  of  high-performance
computing by reducing the work  of  cluster  configuration,  installation,
operation, and management.  Enhancements to previous versions of OSCAR  in
OSCAR 2.3.1  include  a  faster,  multicast-based  version  of  the  OSCAR
installer; a more scalable version of  OSCAR's  remote  command  execution
toolkit; a more expressive packaging API, which allows package authors  to
more easily convey package requirements; and a  redesigned  and  improved,
Qt-toolkit-based,  graphical  user  interface  for   the   OSCAR   Package
Downloader (OPD) wizard.  This improved wizard enables a user to  download
additional  packages  from  on-line  repositories  prior  to  the  cluster
install.

<p>
OSCAR 2.3.1 also includes the new LAM/MPI 7.0 communications library,  and
supports the use of  several  previously  unsupported  software  packages,
including Myrinet, PVFS, and Clumon. These new packages can be downloaded
at the start of an installation via OPD and  then  installed  as  part  of
normal OSCAR installation.

<p>
OSCAR 2.3.1, has been fully tested for use with IA32 processors, under Red
Hat 8.0, 9.0 and Mandrake 9.0.  OSCAR 2.3.1  does  not  support  IA64
platforms.  Those seeking IA64 support should use version 2.2.1  of  OSCAR
for now.

<p>
OSCAR 2.3.1, OSCAR 2.2.1,  and  additional  information  about  the  OSCAR
project are available from the OSCAR project page:
