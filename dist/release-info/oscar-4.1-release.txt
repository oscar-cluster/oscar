OAK RIDGE, Tenn., April 18, 2005 -- The OSCAR working group has released
a new version of the Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR)
toolkit, OSCAR 4.1.

OSCAR is a software package that supports the use of high-performance
computing by reducing the work of cluster  configuration, installation,
operation, and management. Enhancements to previous versions of OSCAR in 
OSCAR 4.1 include full support for Mandrake 10.0 running on IA32 processors.
Enhanced support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux as many bug fixes and 
additions were made to make installation on this platform much better, both
on IA32 and IA64 architectures. APITest has been added to the OSCAR testing
framework and it is envisioned that all installation tests will be performed
by this package in upcoming releases. DepMan and PackMan are now fully 
integrated into the OSCAR installation mechanism. These tools provide RPM 
dependency resolution and the amount of manual work to resolve dependencies
manually has been greatly reduced, both during the server installation and 
the build client image stage.

OSCAR 4.1 has been fully tested for use with IA32 processors under Red
Hat 9.0, Fedora Core 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0, and Mandrake 10.0.
Additionally, IA64 support is also available under Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 3.0.

OSCAR 4.1, previous OSCAR versions, and additional information about the OSCAR
project are available from the OSCAR project page:

Oak Ridge National Laboratory(ORNL), and Sherbrooke University. OSCAR  
is the product of the OSCAR working group of the Open Cluster Group (OCG).
