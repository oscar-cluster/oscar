This is the general README file for OSCAR.  See our wonderful web
site:

	http://oscar.sourceforge.net/

Insturctions for installing an OSCAR distribution can be found in
doc/install.pdf.  User instructions for utilizing the software
installed on OSCAR clusters can be found in doc/user.pdf.


***************************************************************
Notes on the OSCARVERSION release
***************************************************************

There are some limitations to the OSCARVERSION release, they are:

- You MUST specify a domain name for your clients when defining them.

- If the image build fails during install on Red Hat 7.2 or 7.3
  install there are possible fixes:

  1) edit /etc/systeminstaller/systeminstaller.conf to change
       pkginstfail=    1
     to
       pkginstfail=    0

  2) update rpm to rpm-4.0.4-7x which is in the Red Hat updates
     for 7.2 (this will only work for Red Hat 7.2)


***************************************************************
Notes about Python2 shipped with OSCARVERSION:
***************************************************************

- The current version of C3 that is shipped with OSCAR requires
  Python2.  The RPMs that are provided are re-built to work on Red Hat
  7.1 system as well as Red Hat 7.2 system.  However, Red Hat 7.2
  shipps with Python2 so measures were taken so it will be chosen in
  place of the one provided with OSCAR, ie. we decremented the RPM
  release number.

- Due to some multi-distro issues, we're currently including a
  "compatibility" (python2-compat-1.0-1) RPM to resolve the Python2
  PreReq that is slightly different across distros.  (see also:
  packages/c3/RPMS/NOTE.python2)
