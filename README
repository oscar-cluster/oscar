This is the general README file for OSCAR.  See our wonderful web site:

	http://oscar.sourceforge.net/

Insturctions for installing an OSCAR distribution can be found in 
doc/install.pdf.

Notes on the 1.3b1 release
***************************************************************

There are some limitations to the 1.3b1 release, they are:

- You MUST specify a domain name for your clients when defining them.

- If the image build fails during install on Red Hat 7.2 or 7.3 install
  there are possible fixes:

  1) edit /etc/systeminstaller/systeminstaller.conf to change
       pkginstfail=    1
     to
       pkginstfail=    0

  2) update rpm to rpm-4.0.4-7x which is in the Red Hat updates
     for 7.2 (this will only work for Red Hat 7.2)



Notes about Python2 shipped with 1.3b1:

- The current version of C3 that is shipped with OSCAR requires Python2.
  The RPMs that are provided are re-built to work on Red Hat 7.1 system
  as well as Red Hat 7.2 system.  However, Red Hat 7.2 shipps with Python2
  so measures were taken so it will be chosen in place of the one provided
  with OSCAR, ie. we decremented the RPM release number.
  (This has not been tested/re-built for IA-64.)
