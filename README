This is the general README file for OSCAR.  See our wonderful web
site:

	http://oscar.sourceforge.net/

Full installation instructions and release notes for OSCAR can be
found in doc/install.pdf.  If you're brave, well familiar with Linux
system administration and cluster concepts, and feel that you can skip
all the details, you can jump into the OSCAR quick installation
document in doc/quick_install.pdf.

User instructions for utilizing the software installed on OSCAR
clusters can be found in doc/user.pdf.

Note that there are actually three flavors of distribution packages
for OSCAR, depending on your bandwidth and installation/development
needs:

1. "Regular": All the OSCAR installation stuff that most users need to
   install and operate an OSCAR cluster.

2. "Extra Crispy": Same as Regular, except that the SRPMs for most of
   the OSCAR-specific RPMs are also included.  This distribution
   package is significantly larger than Regular, and is not necessary
   for most users -- only those who are interested in source RPMs need
   the Extra Crispy distribution.  The SRPMs can be found under
   packages/*/SRPMS/ directories.

3. "Secret Sauce": This distribution contains *only* the SRPMs for
   OSCAR-specific RPMs in the Regular and Extra Crispy distributions
   (it's essentially (Extra Crispy - Regular)).  It is intended only
   for those who initially downloaded the Regular distribution and
   later decided that they wanted the SRPMs as well.  The Secret Sauce
   distribution is intended to be expanded over your Regular
   installation -- it will create packages/*/SRPMS/ directories and
   populate them with the relevant .src.rpm files.

All three distributions can be downloaded from the main OSCAR web
page.
