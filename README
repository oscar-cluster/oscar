Notes on the 1.3b1 release
***************************************************************

There are some limitations to the 1.3b1 release, they are:

- You MUST specify a domain name for your clients when defining them.

- If the image build fails during install on Red Hat 7.2 or 7.3 install
  there are possible fixes:

  1) edit /etc/systeminstaller/systeminstaller.conf to change
       pkginstfail=    1
     to
       pkginstfail=    0

  2) update rpm to rpm-4.0.4-7x which is in the Red Hat updates
     for 7.2 (this will only work for Red Hat 7.2)
