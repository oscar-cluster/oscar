The OSCAR distibution used to come in two OSCAR tarballs and a set of repository
tarballs were like these:
  oscar-base-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz  : the base OSCAR tarball stripped of
				    almost every binary packages (rpms)
  oscar-srpms-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz : the SRPMS, you only need this if you
				    want to rebuild rpms
  oscar-repo-common-rpms-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz : 
				    repository of noarch rpms used on all
				    supported distributions
  oscar-repo-DISTRO-VER-ARCH-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz :
				    repository of distro and architecture
				    specific rpms.

For those who need to maintain or re-install the old versions of OSCAR:
 - Download the oscar-repo-common-rpms and the oscar-repo-DISTRO-VER-ARCH
 tarballls suitable for the distribution(s). Unpack them in /tftpboot/oscar.
 - Download the oscar-base tarball. Unpack it in an appropriate directory.
 Rename the unpacked directory, if you want (e.g. /opt/oscar)
 - In the unpacked directory (e.g. /opt/oscar) execute:
 ./install_cluster ETH_INTERFACE

 (ETH_INTERFACE is the cluster internal interface on the head node,
 e.g. eth0).
