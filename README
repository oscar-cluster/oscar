***************************************************************
Notes on the 1.2 beta release
***************************************************************

There are some limitations to the 1.2 beta release, they are:

-Only single processors are exploited on the nodes. Be sure and
tell the test script that you have 1 processor per node.

-sshd may not be properly started on the server. Make sure it is
running before installing the nodes.

-If you use rpms from another source other than the RedHat 7.1 
cds, you may recieve some file conflict messages when installing
the server. Just remove the conflicting rpms from /tftpboot/rpms
and rerun install_cluster.

-You MUST specify a domain name for your clients when defining 
them.
