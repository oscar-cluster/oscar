This is the general README file for OSCAR vOSCARVERSION.  See our
wonderful web site:

	http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/

Full installation instructions and release notes for OSCAR can be
found in doc/install.pdf.  If you're brave, well familiar with Linux
system administration and cluster concepts, and feel that you can skip
all the details, you can jump into the OSCAR quick installation
document in doc/quick_install.pdf.

User instructions for utilizing the software installed on OSCAR
clusters can be found in doc/user.pdf.

The OSCAR distibution comes in two OSCAR tarballs and a set of repository
tarballs:
  oscar-base-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz  : the base OSCAR tarball stripped of
				    almost every binary packages (rpms)
  oscar-srpms-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz : the SRPMS, you only need this if you
				    want to rebuild rpms
  oscar-repo-common-rpms-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz : 
				    repository of noarch rpms used on all
				    supported distributions
  oscar-repo-DISTRO-VER-ARCH-OSCARVERSION.tar.gz :
				    repository of distro and architecture
				    specific rpms.

For an OSCAR installation:
 - Download the oscar-repo-common-rpms and the oscar-repo-DISTRO-VER-ARCH
 tarballls suitable for the distribution(s). Unpack them in /tftpboot/oscar.
 - Download the oscar-base tarball. Unpack it in an appropriate directory.
 Rename the unpacked directory, if you want (e.g. /opt/oscar)
 - In the unpacked directory (e.g. /opt/oscar) execute:
 ./install_cluster ETH_INTERFACE

 (ETH_INTERFACE is the cluster internal interface on the head node,
 e.g. eth0).
