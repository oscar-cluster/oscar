This is the general README file for OSCAR.  See our wonderful web site:

	http://oscar.sourceforge.net/

Insturctions for installing an OSCAR distribution can be found in 
doc/install.pdf.


***************************************************************
Notes on the OSCARVERSION release
***************************************************************

There are some limitations to the OSCARVERSION release, they are:

- You MUST specify a domain name for your clients when defining them.

- If the image build fails during install on Red Hat 7.2 or 7.3
  install there are possible fixes:

  1) edit /etc/systeminstaller/systeminstaller.conf to change
       pkginstfail=    1
     to
       pkginstfail=    0

  2) update rpm to rpm-4.0.4-7x which is in the Red Hat updates
     for 7.2 (this will only work for Red Hat 7.2)


***************************************************************
Which MPI do you want to use?
***************************************************************

Starting with OSCAR 1.3, there is a generalized mechanism to both set
a system-level default MPI implementation, and also to allow users to
override the system-level default with their own choice of MPI
implementation.  

This allows multiple MPI implementations to be installed on an OSCAR
cluster (e.g., LAM/MPI and MPICH), yet still provide unambiguous MPI
implementation selection such that "mpicc foo.c -o foo" will give
deterministic results.

The system-level default MPI implementation can be set in two ways:

1. During the OSCAR installation, the GUI will prompt asking which MPI
   should be the system-level default.  This will set the default for
   all users on the system who do not provide their own individual MPI
   settings.

2. As root, execute the command:

   % switcher mpi --list

   This will list all the MPI implementations available.  To set the
   system-level default, execute the command:

   % switcher mpi = name --system

   where "name" is one of the names from the output of the --list
   command.

Setting a user-level default is essentially the same as #2, except
without the "--system" argument.  This will set the user-level default
instead of the system-level default.  Using the special name "none"
will remove the user-level default and revert the user to the
system-level default.

To get a full list of options available, read the switcher(1) man
page, and/or run "switcher --help".


***************************************************************
Notes about Python2 shipped with OSCARVERSION:
***************************************************************

- The current version of C3 that is shipped with OSCAR requires
  Python2.  The RPMs that are provided are re-built to work on Red Hat
  7.1 system as well as Red Hat 7.2 system.  However, Red Hat 7.2
  shipps with Python2 so measures were taken so it will be chosen in
  place of the one provided with OSCAR, ie. we decremented the RPM
  release number.

- Due to some multi-distro issues, we're currently including a
  "compatibility" (python2-compat-1.0-1) RPM to resolve the Python2
  PreReq that is slightly different across distros.  (see also:
  packages/c3/RPMS/NOTE.python2)
