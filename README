This is the general README file for OSCAR.  See our wonderful web site:

	http://oscar.sourceforge.net/

Insturctions for installing an OSCAR distribution can be found in 
doc/install.pdf.


***************************************************************
Notes on the 1.2 beta release
***************************************************************

There are some limitations to the 1.2 beta release, they are:

-The test_install script skips MPICH for now, a new MPICH RPM
will be available soon and this test will return.

-There will be a new MPICH RPM added that uses "ssh" by default
instead of "rsh" ("rsh" is disabled by default in the OSCAR install).

- Only single processors are exploited on the nodes.  Be sure to tell
the test script that you have 1 processor per node.

- sshd may not be properly started on the server.  Make sure it is
running before installing the nodes.

- If you use rpms from another source other than the RedHat 7.1 CDs,
you may recieve some file conflict messages when installing the
server.  Just remove the conflicting RPM filenames from /tftpboot/rpms
and rerun install_cluster.

- You MUST specify a domain name for your clients when defining them.
