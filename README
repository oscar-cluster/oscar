This is the general README file for OSCAR.  See our wonderful web
site:

	http://oscar.sourceforge.net/

Full installation instructions and release notes for OSCAR can be
found in doc/install.pdf.  If you're brave, well familiar with Linux
system administration and cluster concepts, and feel that you can skip
all the details, you can jump into the OSCAR quick installation
document in doc/quick_install.pdf.

User instructions for utilizing the software installed on OSCAR
clusters can be found in doc/user.pdf.
