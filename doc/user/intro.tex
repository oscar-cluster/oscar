\section{Introduction}

OSCAR version \oscarversion is a snapshot of the best known methods
for building, programming, and using clusters. It consists of a fully
integrated and easy to install software bundle designed for high
performance cluster computing. Everything needed to install, build,
maintain, and use a modest sized Linux cluster is included in the
suite, making it unnecessary to download or even install any
individual software packages on your cluster.

OSCAR is the first project by the Open Cluster Group. For more
information on the group and its projects, visit its website
\url{http://www.OpenClusterGroup.org/}.

More information about OSCAR can be found at the OSCAR home page:

Section~\ref{sec:individual-packages} contains the user installation
for OSCAR clusters.  Cluster users will find general instructions on
how to use the software installed on the OSCAR cluster.  Additionally,
the licenses and copyrights of each of the individual software
packages contained in OSCAR are included in
Section~\ref{sec:package-licenses}.
