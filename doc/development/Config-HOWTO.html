<h1>Writing OSCAR Configuration Files</h1>
</center>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this document is to assist you in writing configuration files
for the OSCAR "Configurator".  The OSCAR Configurator allows a package
maintainer to define options which a user can set.  To present these options
to the user, the Configurator uses a simple HTML <B>Form</B>.  While the
basics of writing HTML files and HTML forms are discussed in detail in many
books and online tutorials, this document seeks to describe the HTML form
tags available to a package maintainer and how to use those tags to get
information from the user.
<p>
Many of the basic HTML tags are supported in the OSCAR Configurator,
including:
<ul>
<li>various fonts and headers
<li>line and paragraph breaks
<li>horizontal (ruler) lines
<li>centered text
<li>images (GIFs and JPEGs)
</ul>
There is also a decent assortment of HTML Form tags such
as:
<ul>
<li>input fields
<li>checkboxes
<li>radio buttons
<li>single- and multi-selection lists
<li>text boxes
</ul>
All of the available tags are described in detail below.
<p>
There are some HTML tags that are NOT allowed in a configuration file.  In
particular, you may <font color="#CC0000">not</font> use:
<ul>
<li><font color="#CC0000">&lt;A HREF&gt;</font> - A hypertext link to other
places on the web.  We don't want the user going off to another web page.
<li><font color="#CC0000">&lt;TABLE&gt;, &lt;TR&gt;, &lt;TD&gt;</font> -
While tables are parsed in without difficulty, they are not rendered as true
talbes.  Better to use &lt;PRE&gt; (preformatted text) for this purpose.
<li><font color="#CC0000">&lt;ISINDEX&gt;</font> - The document cannot be
searchable.
<li><font color="#CC0000">Form &lt;SUBMIT&gt;, &lt;BUTTON&gt;, and
&lt;IMAGE&gt;</font> - The Configurator has its own button to submit the
values of the form to the program, so these elements are unnecessary.
<li><font color="#CC0000">&lt;FILE&gt;</font> - The user is not allowed to
upload a file.
</ul>
If any of these tags are present in your HTML document, they are removed
prior to rendering so that your document will appear without the offending
tags.

<h2>A Basic HTML Form Document</h2>
Since all of the configuration input from a user appears in an HTML Form,
the minimum useful configuration file contains &lt;form&gt; and
&lt;/form&gt; tags.  Between these two tags, the package maintainer adds
&lt;input&gt; tags to get input from the user.  For example, if all you want
from the user is his name, your configuration file might be as follows:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           Enter your name: &lt;input name="username"&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
The resulting output would look like this:
<p>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Enter your name: <input name="username">
</form>
<p>
If you are HTML savvy, you may notice a few things missing from this
example.  Specifically, we omitted the main &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;
tags, and the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags.
For basic configuration files, these tags are optional.  You may use them if
you like (and some browsers would bonk if they were absent), but they are
not required.  Also, there are no attributes for the &lt;form&gt; tag.  This
is because the Configurator knows the action to take when the user saves the
values, so no "action" label is needed.  Also, there can be only one pair of
&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tags in the configuration file, so there is no
need for the "name" label.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>A More Complete HTML Form</h2>
A typical HTML document consists of at least two separate sections, a "head"
and a "body".  The most important element of the "head" is the
&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt; tag.  This sets the title of the window and
also acts as the text for the header of the configuration window.  If you
omit this tag or leave the value blank, it defaults to "Configuration".
<p>
The body is where the main part of the HTML document is stored.  It includes
both the Form and any other "standard" HTML elements you want to display.
Many of these elements can appear inside or outside of the Form, so it is
sometimes easiest to have a configuration form that looks like this:
<pre>
           &lt;html&gt;
             &lt;head&gt;
               &lt;title&gt;The Title Of Your Configuration Form&lt;title&gt;
             &lt;/head&gt;

             &lt;body&gt;
               &lt;form&gt;
                 All of your main HTML configuration goes here.
               &lt;/form&gt;
             &lt;/body&gt;
           &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
In HTML files, whitespace (including carriage returns) are usually compacted
to a single space.  So in the above example, the indentation and line
spacing are shown simply to make the example easier to read.  We could just
have easily put everything on a single line and the output would be the
same.  This is important to know since if you want a true line break (say
between paragraphs), you have to explicitly tell HTML by using the &lt;p&gt;
(paragraph) tag.  Also, the case of the tags is unimportant, so you could
also use all uppercase letters for your tags if you find that to me more
readable.

<h2>Basic (non-form) HTML Tags</h2>
There are many HTML tags which can be displayed by the Configurator that
don't need to be in the form, but will be useful anyway.  The function of
each of these tags are not listed here.  There are plenty of HTML reference
books and online tutorials available.  Use your favorite search engine and
do a search on "HTML tutorial" to get a big listing.  A primer available at
NCSA can be found at <a
href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/index.html">archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/index.html</A>.

<h2>HTML Form Tags</h2>
The main tags that you will need for your configuration file are
&lt;form&gt; tags.  These tags allow you do prompt the user for information
to be entered via text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, selection lists,
etc.  This section describes each tag in detail and provides examples.
<p>
Note that all of these tags must appear between a
&lt;form&gt;...&lt;/form&gt; tag pair.  Otherwise your values will not get
submitted correctly.
<p>
<ul>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;input type="text" name="VARIABLE" value="INITIAL" size="NUMCHARS"
maxlength="MAXCHARS"&gt; - <br>
A <i>text</i> element is a single line text input field in which the user
can enter text.  If you do not specify <b>type="text"</b>, then the
&lt;input&gt; defaults to this type of text input field.  Of the various
attributes, only <b>name</b> is required.  The <b>name</b> attribute
designates the variable name for the data entered by the user.  If you also
specify the <b>value</b> attribute, that text appears in the text input field
when it first appears.  The <b>size</b> and <b>maxlength</b> attributes
designate the number of characters that appear in the text box and the
maximum length of the input text respectively.  
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           Enter your name: &lt;input type="text" name="username" value="johndoe" size="20" maxlength="30"&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Enter your name: <input type="text" name="username" value="johndoe" size="20" maxlength="30">
</form>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;input type="password" name="VARIABLE" value="INITIAL"
size="NUMCHARS" maxlength="MAXCHARS"&gt; - <br>
A <i>password</i> element is a text input field in which each character
typed is displayed as a * to conceal the actual value entered.  In all other
aspects, this element is the same as the <i>text</i> element.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           Enter your password: &lt;input type="password" name="password" value="passwd" size="10" maxlength="20"&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Enter your password: <input type="password" name="password" value="passwd" size="10" maxlength="20">
</form>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;input type="checkbox" name="VARIABLE" value="RETURNVALUE"
checked&gt; - <br>
A <i>checkbox</i> is a toggle that the user can select (switch on) or
deselect (switch off).  As with all &lt;input&gt; elements, the <b>name</b>
attribute is required and designates the variable name for the value
returned by the check box.  Usually, "ON" is returned when a check box has
been checked by the user.  If you specify the <b>value</b> attribute, that
value is returned instead when the check box has been checked by the user.
You can optionally specify the <b>checked</b> attribute to make the check
box initially selected when first displayed.  Otherwise, the check box is
unselected when first displayed.  Any check boxes which are not checked when
the form is submitted do not get passed to the Configurator, ie. their
values will be "" (the empty string).
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           &lt;input type="checkbox" name="rootaccess" value="YES" checked&gt; Enable "root" access
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<input type="checkbox" name="rootaccess" value="YES" checked> Enable "root" access
</form>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;input type="radio" name="VARIABLE" value="RETURNVALUE" checked&gt; -
<br>
A <i>radio</i> element is a radio button.  A set of radio buttons consists
of multiple radio buttons that all have the same <b>name</b> attribute.
Only one radio button in the set can be selected at one time.  When the user
selects a button in the set, all other buttons in the set are deselected.
If one radio button in a set has the <b>checked</b> attribute, that one is
selected when the set is first displayed.  Otherwise, none of the radio
buttons are selected when first displayed (which may not be the desired
functionality).  As with all &lt;input&gt; elements, the <b>name</b>
attribute is required and designates the variable name for the value
returned by the radio button set.  All radio buttons with the same
<b>name</b> are in the same set, regardless of where they appear in the
form.  The <b>value</b> attribute is the value that is returned for the
radio button set when the form is submitted.  This default to "ON" which
isn't very useful for a set of radio buttons, so be sure to give each radio
button its own <b>value</b>.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           User type:&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;input type="radio" name="usertype" value="guest"&gt; Guest&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;input type="radio" name="usertype" value="user" checked&gt; User&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;input type="radio" name="usertype" value="admin"&gt; Admin&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
User type:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<input type="radio" name="usertype" value="guest"> Guest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<input type="radio" name="usertype" value="user" checked> User<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<input type="radio" name="usertype" value="admin"> Admin<br>
</form>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;input type="hidden" name="VARIABLE" value="RETURNVALUE"&gt; - <br>
A <i>hidden</i> element is an invisible element whose main purpose is to
contain data that the user does not enter.  This data gets sent when the
form is submitted.  This allows you to always pass a certain name/value pair
to the Configurator without input from the user.  Both the <b>name</b> and
<b>value</b> attributes are required.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           There's a hidden element here!&lt;input type="hidden" name="version" value="5.23"&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
There's a hidden element here!<input type="hidden" name="version" value="5.23">
</form>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;input type="reset" value="LABEL"&gt; - <br>
When the user presses a <i>reset</i> button, all elements in the form are
reset to the values that were present when the form was first displayed.
Usually, the text of this button is "Reset", but you can change this by
specifying the <b>value</b> attribute.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           Reset form: &lt;input type="reset" value="Reset to Original Values"&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Reset form: <input type="reset" value="Reset to Original Values">
</form>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;textarea name="VARIABLE" cols="WIDTH" rows="HEIGHT"
wrap="OFF"|"HARD"|"SOFT"&gt;Text to display&lt;/textarea&gt; - <br>
The <i>textarea</i> tag defines a multiline input field into which the user
can enter text.  As with &lt;input&gt; elements, the <b>name</b> attribute is
required and designates the variable name for the text present in the box
when the form is submitted.  The width and height (in terms of characters)
of the text box is given by the optional <b>cols</b> and <b>rows</b>
attributes.
By default, any text entered by the user is displayed "as is" meaning that
if the line input by the user is longer than the width of the text box, the
text will scroll off the screen.  The only time a new row is started is when
the user types a carriage return.  This is also the behavior when you use
the <b>wrap="OFF"</b> attribute.  If you want to have the text word wrap
automatically, use the <b>wrap="HARD"</b> or <b>wrap="SOFT"</b> attribute.  (In
standard HTML, these two attributes differ by whether or not the extra carriage
returns generated by word wrapping get submitted in the text or not.  For
the Configurator, these extra carriage returns are never submitted, which is
equivalent to <b>wrap="SOFT"</b>, so using <b>wrap="HARD"</b> generates the
same behavior.)  Between the two &lt;textarea&gt;...&lt;/textarea&gt; tags,
you can put optional "Text to display" when the textarea is first displayed.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           Comments?&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;textarea name="comments" cols=40 rows=5 wrap="SOFT"&gt;
           Enter your comments or suggestions here.
           &lt;/textarea&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Comments?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<textarea name="comments" cols=40 rows=5 wrap="SOFT">
Enter your comments or suggestions here.
</textarea>
</form>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
<li>&lt;select name="VARIABLE" size="LISTLENGTH" multiple&gt;<br>
&lt;option value="OPTIONVALUE"&gt;<br>
&lt;option value="OPTIONVALUE" selected&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
&lt;/select&gt; - <br>
The <i>select</i> and <i>option</i> tags define a selection list.  A
selection list displays a list of options from which the user can select one
(or more) items.  If the <b>multiple</b> attribute is present, the user can
select multiple items from the list at a time.  Otherwise, only a single
item can be selected at a time.  As with <b>input</b> elements, the
<b>name</b> attribute is required and designates the variable name for the
value(s) selected in the list when the form is submitted.  The optional
<b>size</b> attribute indicates how many items are presented in the box
before scrolling is necessary.  This defaults to "10".  If you set
<b>size</b> to "1" and do not set the <b>multiple</b> attribute, you get a
single element drop-down list.  
<p>
To actually put items in the selection list, you use the <i>option</i> tag
followed by the text you wish to appear in the list.  You can make that
option selected when the list is initially displayed by using the
<b>selected</b> attribute.  By default, the value that gets returned to the
Configurator when an item is selected is the actual text of the item in the
list.  You can override this behavior by using the optional <b>value</b>
attribute.  When you set this value, it gets returned when that item in the
list is selected.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
           &lt;form&gt;
           Select the machines to use:&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;select name="machinelist" size=5 multiple&gt;
           &lt;option selected&gt;oscar1
           &lt;option&gt;oscar2
           &lt;option&gt;oscar3
           &lt;option&gt;oscar4
           &lt;option&gt;oscar5
           &lt;option&gt;oscar6
           &lt;option value="unlisted"&gt;unlisted machine
           &lt;/select&gt;
           &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Output:
<br>
<form>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Select the machines to use:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<select name="machinelist" size=5 multiple>
<option selected>oscar1
<option>oscar2
<option>oscar3
<option>oscar4
<option>oscar5
<option>oscar6
<option value="unlisted">unlisted machine
</select>
</form>
<p>
Note: when viewing the above example in a standard HTML browser, you might
have to use the &lt;SHIFT&gt; or &lt;CTRL&gt; key in conjunction with
clicking the mouse to select multiple items from the list.  In the
Configurator, this extra step is not required.
