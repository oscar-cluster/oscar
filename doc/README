This directory contains various documents for the OSCAR software
package.  You must run the top-level "configure" script before
attempting to build any of these documents.

Subdirectories that contain LaTeX documents have associated Makefiles
to build postscript and PDF versions of the documents.  They contain
the following make targets:

<default>:    Do nothing
docs:         Build the document into a PDF file
ps:           Build the document into a postscript file
pdf:	      Build the document into a PDF file
clean:	      Remove the postscript and PDF documents, as well as all
	      temporary latex/pdflatex files
mostlyclean:  Remove all the temporary latex/pdflatex files

Note that you *must* make mostlyclean (or clean) between making the
postscript and PDF files; latex and pdflatex create conflicting and
incompatible temporary files.  For example, the following commands
could be used to reliably generate both the postscript and PDF
documents for an OSCAR distribution package and leave no temporary
files:

	 make clean ps
	 make mostlyclean pdf
	 make mostlyclean
