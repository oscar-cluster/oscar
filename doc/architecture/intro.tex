\section{Introduction to OSCAR}

Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR) is a snapshot of the
best known methods for building, programming, and using clusters. It
consists of a fully-integrated and easy to install software bundle
designed for high performance cluster computing.  Everything needed to
install, build, maintain, and use a modest sized Linux cluster is
included in the suite, making it unnecessary to download or even
install any individual software packages on your cluster. Additional
information on OSCAR can be found at the project website,
\xref{http://oscar.sourceforge.net/}{{\tt

OSCAR is the first project by the Open Cluster Group. For more
