\section{OSCAR 1.0 Design Overview}

The design for OSCAR 1.0 can be described as very tightly coupled. In
order to produce a fully-integrated bundle of software, much of the
development focused only on getting a core set of software packages
installed on the cluster nodes and configuring the packages to be
cluster aware. As a result, the user has no choice in what OSCAR
packages to install, and the procedure for doing the installation is
strictly defined by the OSCAR wizard. In addition, no consideration
was given to any changes that may occur to the cluster or software
after the initial installation. Most of the work is handled by shell
and Perl scripts that were developed strictly to serve the purpose of
doing just what was needed at the time to get things to work together,
with very little thought being given to code reuse or future
enhancements.
