\section{Detailed Cluster Installation Procedure}
\label{det:top}

Note: All actions specified herein should be performed by the
\user{root} user.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Server Installation and Configuration}
\label{det:serverinstall}
  
During this phase, you will prepare the machine to be used as the
server for using OSCAR.

\subsubsection{Install Linux on the server machine} 
\label{det:serverosinstall}

If you have a machine you want to use that already has Linux
installed, you may use it and continue with the next section. When
installing Linux, it is required that you use a distribution that is
based upon the RPM standard.  Furthermore, it should be noted that all
testing up to this point has been done using the distributions listed
in Table~\ref{tab:oscar-distro-support} on
page~\pageref{tab:oscar-distro-support}.  As such, use of
distributions other than those listed will require some porting of
OSCAR, as many of the scripts and software within OSCAR are dependent
on those distributions. Do not worry about doing a custom install, as
OSCAR contains all the software on which it depends.  The only other
installation requirement is that some X environment such as GNOME or
KDE must be installed. Therefore, a typical workstation install is
sufficient.

If you install Red Hat on the server machine, during the
installation you should enable the ipchains-base firewall that is
included with the Red Hat distribution in medium mode.  Other
firewalls that are stronger and more versatile can be installed later,
but this will offer some protection until that time.  Note that OSCAR
currently assumes that only the server machine is exposed to the
general network, with the server and the rest of the cluster's
machines being on a private network. To keep the Red Hat firewall from
interfering with network traffic between the server machine and the
other machines in the cluster, OSCAR automatically disables portions
of the Red Hat firewall. This may not have the intended results in the
situation where all the cluster machines are exposed on the general
network.  See Appendix~\ref{app:security} for more information about
firewalls and other security software that can be installed.

\subsubsection{Disk space and directory considerations}
\label{det:serverdiskpar}

OSCAR has certain requirements for server disk space. Space will be
needed to store the Linux RPMs and to store the images.  The RPMs will
be stored in \file{/tftpboot/rpm}. Approximately 1 gigabyte is
required to store the RPMs.  The images are stored in
\file{/var/lib/systemimager} and will need approximately 1 gigabyte
per image. Only 1 image is required, although you may want to create
more in the future.

If you are installing a new server, it is suggested that you allow for 
2 gigabytes in both the \file{/}, which contains \file{/tftpboot},  
and \file{/var} filesystems when partitioning the disk on your server.

If you are using an existing server, you will need to verify that you have 
enough space on the disk partitions. Again 2 gigabytes of free space
is recommended in both the \file{/} and \file{/var} partitions.

You can check
the amount of free space on your drive's partitions by issuing the
command \cmd{df -h} in a terminal.  The result for each file system is
located below the \panel{Avail} heading. If your root (\file{/})
partition has enough free space, enter the following command in a
terminal:

\begin{verbatim}
  mkdir -p /tftpboot/rpm
\end{verbatim}
  
If your root partition does not have enough free space, create the
directories on a different partition that does have enough free space
and create links to them from the root (\file{/}) directory.  For
example, if the partition containing \file{/usr} contains enough
space, you could do so by using the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
  mkdir -p /usr/tftpboot/rpm
  ln -s /usr/tftpboot /tftpboot
\end{verbatim}

The same procedure should be repeated for the \file{/var/lib/systemimager}
subdirectory.

    
\subsubsection{Get a copy of OSCAR and unpack on the server} 
\label{det:unpack}

If you are reading this, you probably already have a copy. If not, go
to \url{http://oscar.sourceforge.net/} and download the latest OSCAR
tarball, which will be named something like
\file{oscar-\oscarversion.tar.gz}.  The version used in these
instructions is \oscarversion, which you should replace with the
version you download in any of the sample commands. Copy the OSCAR
tarball to a directory such as \file{/root} on your server.  There is
no required installation directory, except that you may not use
\file{/usr/local/oscar}, which is reserved for special use. Do {\bf
  not} unpack the tarball on a Windows based machine and copy the
directories over to the server, as this will convert all the scripts
to the dreaded ``DOS'' format and will render them useless under
Linux.  Assuming you placed the OSCAR tarball in \file{/root}, open a
command terminal and issue the following commands to unpack OSCAR:

% We have to use \tt instead of {verbatim} because we need to use
% \oscarversion inside.  This makes it somewhat painful -- much less
% easy than {verbatim}.
\vspace{11pt}
{\tt
  cd /root \\
\indent  tar -zxvf oscar-\oscarversion.tar.gz
}
\vspace{11pt}
    
The result is the creation of an OSCAR directory structure that is
laid out as show in Table~\ref{tab:oscar-dir-struct} (again assuming
\file{/root}).

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{3in}|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Directory} &
      \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Contents} \\
      \hline
      \hline
      \file{/root/oscar-\oscarversion/} & the base OSCAR directory \\

      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{OSCAR distribution package file and directory layout.}
    \label{tab:oscar-dir-struct}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Configure the ethernet adapter for the cluster} 
\label{det:serveradapter}

Assuming you want your server to be connected to both an external
network and the internal cluster subnet, you will need to have two
ethernet adapters installed in the server. It is preferred that you do
this because exposing your cluster may be a security risk, and certain
software used in OSCAR such as DHCP may conflict with your external
network.  Once both adapters have been physically installed and you
have booted Linux into an X environment, open a terminal and enter the
command:

\begin{verbatim}
  /usr/sbin/netcfg &
\end{verbatim}
  
The network configuration utility will be started, which you will use
to configure your network adapters.
  
At this point, the \panel{Names} panel will be active. On this panel
you will find the settings for the server's hostname, domain,
additional search domains, and name servers. All of this information
should have been filled in by the standard Linux installation. To
configure your ethernet adapters, you will need to first press the
\button{Interfaces} button to bring up the panel that allows you to
update the configuration of all of your server machines interfaces.
You should now select the interface that is connected to the cluster
network by clicking on the appropriate device. If your external
adapter is configured on device ``\file{eth0}'', then you should most
likely select ``\file{eth1}'' as the device, assuming you have no
other adapters installed. After selecting the appropriate interface,
press the \button{Edit} button to update the information for the
cluster network adapter. Enter a private IP address\footnote { There
  are three private IP address ranges: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255;
  172.16.0.0 to 172.32.255.255; and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.
  Additional information on private intranets is available in RFC
  1918.  You should not use the IP addresses 10.0.0.0 or 172.16.0.0 or
  192.168.0.0 for the server.  If you use one of these addresses the
  network installs of the client nodes will fail (rpc has problems).
  } and the associated netmask\footnote{The netmask 255.255.255.0
  should be sufficient for most OSCAR clusters.}  in their respective
fields. Additionally, you should be sure to press the \button{Activate
  interface at boot time} button and set the \button{Interface
  configuration protocol} to ``none''.  After completing the updates,
press the \button{Done} button to return to the main utility window,
pressing the \button{Save} button in the Save current configuration
menu that pops up.  Then press the \button{Save} button at the bottom
of the main network configuration window to confirm your changes, and
then press the \button{Quit} to leave the network configuration
utility.
  
Now reboot your machine to ensure that all the changes are propagated
to the appropriate configuration files. To confirm that all ethernet
adapters are in the \msg{UP} state, once the machine has rebooted,
open another terminal window and enter the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
  /sbin/ifconfig -a
\end{verbatim}
  
You should see \msg{UP} as the first word on the third line of output
for each adapter. If not, there is a problem that you need to resolve
before continuing. Typically, the problem is that the wrong module is
specified for the given device. Try using the network configuration
utility again to resolve the problem.
  
\subsubsection{Copy distribution RPMs to \file{/tftpboot/rpm}}
\label{det:rpmcopy}

In this step, you need to copy the RPMs included with your Linux
distribution into the \file{/tftpboot/rpm} directory.  Insert each of
the distribution CDs in turn.  When each one is inserted, linux will
automatically make the contents of the CD be available in the
\file{/mnt/cdrom} directory.  Then for each CD locate the directory
that contains the RPMs.  In Red Hat 7.1, the RPMs are located in the
\file{RedHat/RPMS} directory, which will appear on the system as the
\file{/mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS} directory.  After locating the RPMs on
the each CD, copy them into \file{/tftpboot/rpm} with a command such
as:

\begin{verbatim}
  cp /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/*.rpm /tftpboot/rpm
\end{verbatim}
  
Be sure to repeat the above process for all CDs. 
After using each CD you will have to unmount it from the local
file system by issuing these commands:

\begin{verbatim}
  cd
  umount /mnt/cdrom
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
\subsection{Initial OSCAR Server Configuration}

During this phase, the software needed to run OSCAR will be installed
on the server. In addition, some initial server configuration will be
performed. The steps from here forward should be run within the X
environment, due to the graphical nature of the OSCAR.

\subsubsection{Change to the OSCAR directory and run \file{install\_cluster}}
\label{det:installcluster}

If the OSCAR directory was placed in \file{/root} for example, you
would issue the following commands:

% We have to use \tt instead of {verbatim} because we need to use
% \oscarversion inside.  This makes it somewhat painful -- much less
% easy than {verbatim}.
\vspace{11pt}
{\tt
  cd /root/oscar-\oscarversion \\
\indent  ./install\_cluster eth0
}
\vspace{11pt}
  
In the above command, substitute the device name (e.g., \file{eth0})
for your server's internal ethernet adapter. Also note that the
\file{install\_cluster} script must be run from within the OSCAR base
directory as shown above. The script will first run the part one
server configuration script, which does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item copies OSCAR RPMs to /tftpboot/rpm
\item installs all OSCAR server RPMs
\item updates \file{/etc/hosts} with OSCAR aliases
\item updates \file{/etc/exports} 
\item adds OSCAR paths to \file{/etc/profile} 
\item updates system startup (\file{/etc/rc.d/init.d}) scripts
\item restarts affected services
\item if all the above is successful, launch \file{oscar\_wizard}
\end{enumerate}
  
The wizard, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:detailed-oscar-wizard}, is provided to guide you
through the rest of the cluster installation.  To use the wizard, you
will complete a series of steps, with each step being initiated by the
pressing of a button on the wizard. Do not go on to the next step
until the instructions say to do so, as there are times when you must
complete an action outside of the wizard before continuing on with the
next step. For each step, there is also a \button{Help} button located
directly to the right of the step button. When pressed, the
\button{Help} button displays a message box describing the purpose of
the step.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=\imgscale]{oscar-wizard.\figext}
    \caption{OSCAR Wizard.}
    \label{fig:detailed-oscar-wizard}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
  
As each of the steps are performed, there is output generated that is
displayed to the user. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Cluster Definition}
\label{sec:detailed-cluster-def}

During this phase, you will complete steps one through five of the
OSCAR wizard in defining your cluster. If you encounter problems or
wish to redo any of the SIS actions performed in the wizard steps 1,
or 2, please refer to the SIS man pages.

\subsubsection{Build the Image} 
\label{det:buildimage}

Press the Step 1 button of the wizard entitled \button{Build OSCAR
Client Image}. A dialog will be displayed. In most cases, the defaults 
will be sufficient. You should verify that the disk partition file is
the proper type for your client nodes. The sample files have the
disk type as the last part of the filename. You may also want to change
the post installation action and the IP assignment methods.
\msg{It is important to note that if you wish to
  use automatic reboot, you should make sure the BIOS on each client
  is set to boot from the local hard drive before attempting a network
  boot by default. If you have to change the boot order to do a
  network boot before a disk boot to install your client machines, you
  should not use automatic reboot.} 
Once you are satisfied with the input, click the \button{Build Image} button.

Building the image will take a few minutes, the progress bar on the bottom 
will give you the status and a small dialog will appear when the image
is complete.  If image fails, see Section \ref{sec:release-notes}.
  
A sample dialog is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:detailed-build-image}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=\imgscale]{build-image.\figext}
    \caption{Build the image.}
    \label{fig:detailed-build-image}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
  
\paragraph{Customizing your image}

The defaults of this panel use the sample disk partition and rpm package files
that can be found in the \file{oscarsamples} directory.
At some point, you may want to customize these files to make the image
suit your particular requirements.

\subparagraph{Disk partitioning}

The disk partition file contains a line for each partition desired, where
each line is in the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
<partition>  <size in megabytes>  <type>  <mount point>  <options>
\end{verbatim}

Here is a sample:

\begin{verbatim}
/dev/sda1       24          ext2      /boot   rw
/dev/sda5       128         swap
/dev/sda6       1000        ext2     /        rw
\end{verbatim}

The last partition specified will grow to fill the entire disk.
You can create your own partition files, but make sure that you
don't exceed the physical capacity of your client hardware. The sample
listed above, and some others, are in the \file{oscarsamples} directory.

\subparagraph{Package lists}
The package list is simply a list of rpm file names, 1
per line. Be sure and include all of the prerequisites that
any packages you might add have. You do not need to specify
the architecture portion of the filename, or the .rpm extension.

\subparagraph{Custom kernels}
If you want to use a customized kernel, you can add it to the image
after it is built. Follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Copy the kernel and associated files (System.map, module-info, etc.) into the \\
\file{/var/lib/systemimager/images/<imagename>/boot} directory.
\item Edit the \file{systemconfig.conf} file in the \\
\file{/var/lib/systemimager/images/<imagename>/etc/systemconfig/} 
directory and change the \emph{PATH} parameter in the \emph{[KERNEL0]} stanza to 
match your new kernel's filename.
\item When the clients are installed, they will copy over and boot your new
kernel. 
\end{enumerate}
Note that there is no \file{lilo.conf} file in the image. That file is created
by System Configurator from the contents of the \file{systemconfigurator.conf} file.

See the \file{systemconfig.conf} man page for full details on the
contents of this file.

\subsubsection{Define your client machines} 
\label{det:defclients}

Press the Step 2 button of the wizard entitled \button{Define OSCAR
 Clients}. In the dialog box that is displayed, enter the
appropriate information. Again the defaults will be correct in most
cases. At a minumum, you will need to enter a value in the \field{Number of Hosts}
to specify how many clients you want to create.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The \field{Image Name} field should specify the image name that was used to 
create the image in Step 1.

\item The \field{Domain Name} field should be used to specify the client's IP
domain name. This field \emph{must} have a value. It should contain the server's
domain if it has one. If it is blank, enter a domain like \emph{oscardomain}.

\item The \field{Base name} field is used to specify the first part of the 
client name and hostname. It will have an index appended to the end of it.

\item The \field{Number of Hosts} field specifys how many clients to create.

\item The \field{Starting Number} specifies the index to append
to the \field{Base Name} to derive the first client name. It will be incremented
for each subsequent client.

\item The \field{Starting IP} specifies the IP address of the first client. It 
will be incremented for each subsequent client.

\item The \field{Subnet Mask} specifies the IP netmask for the clients.

\item The \field{Default Gateway} specifies the default route for the clients.

\end{enumerate}
  
When finished entering information, press the \button{Addclients} button.
A sample dialog is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:detailed-define-clients}. 

After the clients are created,
a dialog will pop up with the completion status. After closing that 
you may press the \button{Close} button and continue with the next step.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=\imgscale]{define-clients.\figext}
    \caption{Define the Clients.}
    \label{fig:detailed-define-clients}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
    
\subsubsection{Collect client MAC addresses and Setup Networking} 
\label{det:setupnetwork}

The MAC address of a client
is a twelve hex-digit hardware address embedded in the client's
ethernet adapter. MAC addresses look like, \emph{00:0A:CC:01:02:03}, as
opposed to the familiar format of IP addresses. These MAC addresses
uniquely identify client machines on a network before they are
assigned IP addresses. DHCP uses the MAC address to assign IP 
addresses to the clients.

In order to collect the MAC addresses,  press the Step 3 button
of the wizard entitled \button{Setup Networking}. The
OSCAR network utility dialog box will be displayed.
To use this tool, you will need to know
how to network boot your client nodes.  For instructions on doing
so, see Appendix~\ref{app:net-boot-client-nodes}. A sample dialog
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:detailed-collect-mac}. 

To start the collection, press the \button{Start Collecting} button and then
network boot the first client.  As the clients broadcast, their MAC addresses
will show up in the left hand window. Select a MAC address and the appropriate
client in the right side window. Click \button{Assign MAC to node} to 
associate that MAC address with that node. If you would like to make 
specific nodes associated with specific client definitions, you should
boot them one at a time. If you don't care which node gets associated
with which client, you may boot them all at once and randomly assign
the MAC addresses.

When you have collected all of the MAC addresses, click the \button{Stop Collecting}
button and then click the \button{Configure DHCP Server} button to configure it.
 
You may also configure your remote boot method from this panel. The
\button{Build Autoinstall Floppy} button will build a boot floppy for
client nodes that do not support PXE booting. The \button{Setup Network 
Boot} button will configure the server to answer PXE boot requests if
your client hardware supports it. See Appendix~\ref{app:net-boot-client-nodes}
for more details.
When you have collected the
addresses for all your client nodes, and completed the networks setup
press \button{Close}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=\imgscale]{collect-mac.\figext}
    \caption{Collect client MAC addresses.}
    \label{fig:detailed-collect-mac}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Client Installations}
\label{det:clientinstall}

During this phase, you will network boot your client nodes and they
will automatically be installed and configured as specified in
Section~\ref{sec:detailed-cluster-def} above. For a detailed
explanation of what happens during client installation, see
Appendix~\ref{app:client-install}.

\subsubsection{Network boot the client nodes}

See Appendix~\ref{app:net-boot-client-nodes} for instructions on
network booting clients.

\subsubsection{Check completion status of nodes}
\label{det:clientfinish}

After a few minutes, the clients should complete the installation.
You can watch the client consoles to monitor the progress. Depending
on the Post Installation Action you selected when building the image,
the clients will either halt, reboot or beep incessantly when the 
installation is completed. 
The time required for installation depends on the capabilities of
your server, your clients, your network, and the number of simultaneous 
client installations, it should complete within a few minutes.
  
\subsubsection{Reboot the client nodes}

After confirming that a client has completed its installation, you
should reboot the node from its hard drive. If you chose to have your
clients reboot after installation, they will do this on their
own. If the clients are not set to reboot, you must manually
reboot them. The filesystems will have been unmounted so it is safe
to simply reset or power cycle them.
 \msg{Note: If you had to change the BIOS boot
  order on the client to do a network boot before booting from the
  local disk, you will need to reset the order to prevent the node
  from trying to do another network install.}

\subsubsection{Check network connectivity to client nodes}
\label{det:pingclients}

In order to perform the final cluster configuration, the server must
be able to communicate with the client nodes over the network. If a
client's ethernet adapter is not properly configured upon boot,
however, the server will not be able to communicate with the client. A
quick and easy way to confirm network connectivity is to do the
following (assuming OSCAR installed in \file{$^\sim$root}):

% We have to use \tt instead of {verbatim} because we need to use
% \oscarversion inside.  This makes it somewhat painful -- much less
% easy than {verbatim}.
\vspace{11pt}
{\tt
  cd $^\sim$/oscar-\oscarversion/scripts \\
\indent  ./ping\_clients
}
\vspace{11pt}

The above commands will run the \cmd{ping\_clients} script, which will
attempt to ping each defined client and will print a message stating
success or failure. If a client cannot be pinged, there was a problem
configuring the ethernet adapter, and you will have to log in to the
machine and manually configure the adapter. Once all the clients have
been installed, rebooted, and their network connections have been
confirmed, you may proceed with the next step.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Cluster Configuration}

During this phase, the server and clients will be configured to work
together as a cluster.

\subsubsection{Complete the cluster configuration}
\label{det:completeinstall}

Press the Step 4 button of the wizard entitled \button{Complete
 Cluster Setup}.  This will run the \file{post\_install} script,
which does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Queries number of processors from the client nodes.
  
\end{enumerate}

  Note that any users created on the server after the OSCAR
  installation will not be in the password/group files of the clients
  until they have been synced with the server - you can accomplish
  this using the C3 \cmd{cpush} tool.


\subsubsection{Test your cluster using the OSCAR Cluster Test
  software}
\label{det:testcluster}
            
Provided along with OSCAR is a simple test to make sure the key
cluster components (PBS, MPI, and PVM) are functioning properly. 

Press the Step 5 button of the wizard entitled \button{Test
 Cluster Setup}. This will open a window that will test 
 the server services and then ask for a non-root user to use for the
 testing. A sample dialog is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:detailed-setup-test}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=\imgscale]{setup-test.\figext}
    \caption{Setup cluster tests}
    \label{fig:detailed-setup-test}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
 
 Once the test setup completes do the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item open another terminal 
 \item login as the user you gave in the setup
 \item change to the \file{OSCAR\_test} directory
 \item change to the \file{testing} directory 
 \item run the \file{test\_cluster} script, answering the questions
 that are asked.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Congratulations!!}

Your cluster setup is now complete. Your cluster nodes should
be ready for work.
