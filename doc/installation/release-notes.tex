\section{Release Notes}
\label{sec:release-notes}
The following release notes apply to OSCAR version \oscarversion:

\begin{itemize}
\item The documentation is not yet complete.  In particular, the
  installation doc (i.e., this document) needs an overhaul before 1.3
  is finally released.  It has not been updated since 1.2, and
  therefore has many inaccuracies, specific references to RedHat 7.1,
  etc.
  
  Do not despair -- this will definitely happen before 1.3 (final) is
  released.  Until then, bear with us, and send your questions to the
  OSCAR users / development list.
  
\item You {\em must} specify a domain name for your clients when
  defining them.
  
\item The current version of C3 that is shipped with OSCAR requires
  Python 2.x.  The RPMs that are provided are re-built to work on Red
  Hat 7.1 system as well as Red Hat 7.2 system.  However, Red Hat 7.2
  ships with Python 2.x so measures were taken so it will be chosen in
  place of the one provided with OSCAR.  Specifically, we decremented
  the RPM release number.
  
\item Due to some multi-distro issues, we're currently including a
  ``compatibility'' (\file{python2-compat-1.0-1}) RPM to resolve the
  Python2 prerequsite that is slightly different across different
  Linux distributions (also see the file
  \file{packages/c3/RPMS/NOTE.python2}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RedHat 7.2 Notes}
\label{subsec:rh72notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item You will need to update the \rpmname{rpm} RPM to
  \file{rpm-4.0.4-7x} -- the version that ships on the 7.2 CD is
  buggy.  The 4.0.4-7x version is available on the Red Hat updates for
  7.2 (\url{ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.2/en/os/i386/}).
  
\item The image build may fail during install, you may need to edit
  file \file{/etc/\-systeminstaller/\-systeminstaller.conf} and change
  the following:

\begin{verbatim}
       pkginstfail=    1
\end{verbatim}

  to

\begin{verbatim}
       pkginstfail=    0
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RedHat 7.3 Notes}
\label{subsec:rh73notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Note that this is not a formally supported distribution.  OSCAR
  \oscarversion has been only somewhat tested on this distribution
  (see Table~\ref{tab:oscar-distro-support}).

\item You may need the same \file{systeminstaller.com} fix as listed
  in the RedHat 7.2 Notes section, above.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandrake 8.2 Notes}
\label{subsec:mdk82notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Note that this is not a formally supported distribution.  OSCAR
  \oscarversion has been only somewhat tested on this distribution
  (see Table~\ref{tab:oscar-distro-support}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IA64 and Other Bleeding Edge Systems Notes}
\label{subsec:ia64notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item \rpmname{pvm} does not currently work on Itanium.

\item The OSCAR autoinstall diskette will probably not work
on Itanium systems, but they mostly have support for network booting.

\item Some Itanium 1 or 2 systems are supported by OSCAR 
under RedHat's Linux 7.2 release for Itanium.
Itanium systems that can use the standard RedHat Itanium
kernel for booting and network access should work with OSCAR.

\item If an Itanium (or an IA32 based) system 
has new or unknown hardware that is not supported by
the stock kernel in the base operating system release,
it will not work with standard OSCAR, since OSCAR uses the
kernel RPMS supplied with the vendors release to boot and
load the compute nodes.
If you have a custom compiled kernel/modules that works
for your hardware, you should look at the NCSA utilities
at \url{http://oscar.ncsa.uiuc.edu/oscar/} to enable you
to use them in OSCAR.

\end{itemize}
