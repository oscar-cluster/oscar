\section{Release Notes}

The following release notes apply to OSCAR version \oscarversion:

\begin{itemize}
\item The documentation is not yet complete.  In particular, the
  installation doc (i.e., this document) needs an overhaul before 1.3
  is finally released.  It has not been updated since 1.2, and
  therefore has many inaccuracies, specific references to RedHat 7.1,
  etc.
  
  Do not despair -- this will definitely happen before 1.3 (final) is
  released.  Until then, bear with us, and send your questions to the
  OSCAR users / development list.
  
\item You {\em must} specify a domain name for your clients when
  defining them.
  
\item If the image build fails during install on Red Hat 7.2 or 7.3
  install, the following fixes are possible:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item edit \file{/etc/systeminstaller/systeminstaller.conf} to
  change:

\begin{verbatim}
       pkginstfail=    1
\end{verbatim}

     to
\begin{verbatim}
       pkginstfail=    0
\end{verbatim}
     
   \item update the \rpmname{rpm} to \file{rpm-4.0.4-7x} which is in
     the Red Hat updates for 7.2 (this will only work for Red Hat 7.2).
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item The current version of C3 that is shipped with OSCAR requires
  Python 2.x.  The RPMs that are provided are re-built to work on Red
  Hat 7.1 system as well as Red Hat 7.2 system.  However, Red Hat 7.2
  ships with Python 2.x so measures were taken so it will be chosen in
  place of the one provided with OSCAR.  Specifically, we decremented
  the RPM release number.
  
\item Due to some multi-distro issues, we're currently including a
  ``compatibility'' (\file{python2-compat-1.0-1}) RPM to resolve the
  Python2 prerequsite that is slightly different across different
  Linux distributions (also see the file
  \file{packages/c3/RPMS/NOTE.python2}).

\end{itemize}
