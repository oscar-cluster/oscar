\subsection{Notes for All Systems}
\label{subsec:release-notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item There is currently a known issue with the Delete Nodes functionality.
  You may notice error messages like the following when you delete the
  last node of a cluster:

  \begin{verbatim}
    /opt/oscar/packages/sis/scripts/post_clients: illegal or
    non-understood where string <nics.driver_module = >
    /opt/oscar/packages/sis/scripts/post_clients: INTERNAL
    ODA ERROR - failing to convert where expression
    <nics.driver_module = > in oda::delete_records - at 
    least one record not deleted in table <nics> in database <oscar>
    /opt/oscar/packages/sis/scripts/post_clients: illegal or
    non-understood where string <nics.gateway = >
    /opt/oscar/packages/sis/scripts/post_clients: INTERNAL
    ODA ERROR - failing to convert where expression
    <nics.gateway = > in oda::delete_records - at least one
    record not deleted in table <nics> in database <oscar>
    /opt/oscar/packages/sis/scripts/post_clients: illegal or
    non-understood where string <nics.assignment_method = >
  \end{verbatim}

  This is not 'harmful' but will leave the ODA database inconsistent
  with the SIS database.  The information on network interfaces is
  currently not used therefore it is not really damaging to your
  installation.  This will be fixed in the next release.


\item Each package in OSCAR has its own installation and release
  notes.  \detailed{See Section~\ref{sec:pkg-specific-notes} for
  additional release notes.} \quick{See the full Installation Guide
  for these notes.}

\item All nodes must have a hostname other than ``{\tt localhost}''
  that does not contain any underscores (``{\tt \_}'').
  
\item A domain name must be specified for the client nodes when
  defining them.

%TJN: KEEP THIS (if we keep the python2-compat rpms under c3?)
\item Due to some distribution portability issues, OSCAR currently installs
  a ``compatibility''  (\file{python2\--compat\--1.0-1}) RPM to resolve the
  Python2 prerequisite that is slightly different across different Linux
  distributions.  Also see the file \file{packages/c3/RPMS/NOTE.python2}.

\item In some cases, the test window that is opened from the 
  OSCAR wizard may close suddenly when there is a test failure. If
  this happens, run the test script, \file{testing/test\_cluster},
  manually in a shell window to diagnose the problem.
 
\item Although OSCAR can be installed on pre-existing server nodes, it
  is typically easiest to use a machine that has a new, fresh install
\begchange
  of a distribution listed in Table~\ref{tab:oscar-distro-support}
  {\em with no updates installed}.  If the updates are installed,
  there may be conflicts in RPM requirements.  It is recommended to
  install RedHat updates {\em after} the initial OSCAR installation has
  completed.  On the Mandrake systems the security updates must be added
  prior to the install.
  
\item The following benign warning messages will appear multiple times
  during the OSCAR installation process:

\begin{verbatim}
  rsync_stub_dir: no such variable at ...

  Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//) at 
  /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/oda.pm ...
\end{verbatim}
\endchange

  It is safe to ignore these messages.
  
\item The OSCAR installer will install the MySQL package on the server
  node if it is not already installed.  You will be prompted to enter a
\begchange
  password to be used for the MySQL database.
\endchange  

\item The OSCAR installer GUI provides little protection for user
  mistakes.  If the user executes steps out of order, or provides
  erroneous input, Bad Things may happen.  Users are strongly
  encouraged to closely follow the instructions provided in this
  document.

\item The OSCAR installer GUI currently does not support deleting a
  node and adding the same node back {\em in the same session}.  If
  you wish to delete a node and then add it back, you must delete the
  node, close the OSCAR installer GUI, launch the OSCAR installer GUI
  again, and then add the node.

\item During the \button{Build OSCAR Client Image} step, the ``Successfully
  created image'' notice will appear even though the status bar looks
  incomplete.  This incomplete status bar can be ignored.

\begchange
\item If \cmd{ssh} produces warnings when logging into the compute
  nodes from the OSCAR head node, the C3 tools (e.g., \cmd{cexec}) may
  experience difficulties.  For example, if you use \cmd{ssh} to login
  in to the OSCAR head node from a terminal that does not support X
  windows and then try to run \cmd{cexec}, you might see a warning
  message in the \cmd{cexec} output:

\begin{verbatim}
  Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for 
  X11 forwarding.
\end{verbatim}
  
  Although this is only a warning message from \cmd{ssh}, \cmd{cexec}
  may interpret it as a fatal error, and not run across all cluster
  nodes properly (e.g., the \button{Install/Uninstall Packages} button
  will likely not work properly).

  Note that this is actually an \cmd{ssh} problem, not a C3 problem.
  As such, you need to eliminate any warning messages from ssh (more
  specifically, eliminate any output from \file{stderr}).  In the
  example above, you can tell the C3 tools to use the ``\cmd{-x}''
  switch to \cmd{ssh} in order to disable X forwarding:

\begin{verbatim}
  # export C3_RSH='ssh -x'
  # cexec uptime
\end{verbatim}
  
  The warnings about \cmd{xauth} should no longer appear (and the
  \button{Install/Uninstall Packages} button should work properly).
  
\item The \button{Cancel} button in the \button{Install/Uninstall
    Package} step does not work properly; if any packages are selected
  to be installed or uninstalled, clicking the \button{Cancel} button
  still triggers the execution of the package installer/uninstaller.
  This will be fixed in a future release.  The same behavior occurs if
  you close the window via the window manager's ``close''
  functionality.

  Note that if you do not select any additional packages to
  install/uninstall, nothing will run (as expected).

\item The SIS multicast facility (Flamethrower) is ``experimentally''
  supported.  If you are having problems with multicast and would like
  to experiment please check the {\tt oscar-users} and/or
  {\tt sisuite-users} mailing lists for tips.

\endchange

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Red Hat 9 Notes}
\label{subsec:rh90notes}

There are a few issues that may crop up when using OSCAR on Red Hat 9.
The following items highlight these issues.

\begin{itemize}

\item Deselecting Pfilter causes the image creation to fail.  This is
  due to a dependency with IPtables and when Pfilter is not selected
  the IPtables RPM is not listed in the node (image) rpmlist.   The simple
  fix is to add ``iptables'' to the Red Hat 9 rpmlist if you are not
  installing Pfilter on the compute nodes.

\item The RPM system has been updated with this Red Hat release.  The
 OSCAR install process will likely display several warnings due to unsigned
 RPMS.  These warnings can be ignored. 

%TJN: These are the notes Jeff posted for the "Re: mksiimage hang problems"
%  thread on oscar-devel (2003-07-23)
\item In some OSCAR pre-release testing, RPM would hang during the
  building of a client image (Section~\ref{det:build-client-image}).
  This is a documented bug in the version of RPM that ships with
  Redhat 9; it is not a problem with OSCAR.  The procedure
  that was used to remedy this situation is outlined below (excerpts
  taken from \url{http://www.rpm.org/hintskinks/repairdb-2003-06/}):
        \begin{itemize}
        \item If RPM hangs at any point (e.g., building the client
          image) -- first ensure that it really has hung and just
          isn't taking a long, long time to complete.  Typical
          indications that it has genuinely hung include: the disk is
          not running and load goes down to 0 (or nearly 0) and stays
          there.
          
        \item Then do a \cmd{ps} and find the PID of the \cmd{rpm}
          process:
\begin{verbatim}
  # ps -eadf | grep rpm | grep -v grep
  ...output...
  # kill <PID_of_RPM>
\end{verbatim}
          
        \item This will probably not kill the process (it's likely to
          be in a state where it is ignoring signals), but it should
          be tried anyway -- this would allow \cmd{rpm} to exit
          cleanly.  If \cmd{rpm} does exit cleanly, jump down to the
          last step in this procedure.
          
        \item If \cmd{rpm} does not exit within a short period of
          time, \cmd{kill -9 <PID\_of\_RPM>}.  This guarantees that
          \cmd{rpm} will not exit cleanly, but in this case, it's ok.
          Now, do the following:
                        \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Save a copy of the RPM database (just to
                          be safe):
\begin{verbatim}
  # cd /var/lib
  # tar zcvf /tmp/rpmdb.tar.gz rpm
\end{verbatim}
                          
                        \item Delete any existing RPM database locks:
\begin{verbatim}
  # cd /var/lib/rpm
  # rm -f __db*
\end{verbatim}
                          
                        \item Rebuild the RPM database:
\begin{verbatim}
  # rpm -vv --rebuilddb
\end{verbatim}
                        \end{enumerate}
                        
                      \item Now re-run the OSCAR step that hung.  If
                        RPM hangs again, repeat these steps to un-hang
                        it.  Testing has shown that it may be
                        necessary to repeat these steps multiple times
                        in order to get a successful RPM run.
        \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fedora Core 2 Notes}
\label{subsec:fc2notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item SIS currently does not fully support 2.6 kernel, the way we make it
  work right now is to run a script which generate \file{/etc/modprobe.conf} 
  from \file{/etc/modules.conf} - this does not work 100\% of the time.  If 
  you can deploy an image to your client nodes but are having problems 
  booting, chances are this is the issue.  To get around this problem, copy a
  working \file{modprobe.conf} for your client nodes to the image directory 
  \file{/var\-/lib\-/systemimager\-/images\-/oscarimage\-/etc/}.  Re-image the
  nodes and it should work.  One quick way of getting the correct
  \file{modprobe.conf} is to boot a node with the Fedora Core 2 CD 1 
  and run the Rescue mode.  You will then be able to find
  \file{modprobe.conf} in \-/tmp.

\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Mandrake 9.0 Notes}
%\label{subsec:mdk90notes}
%
%The following may need to be run before attempting to install OSCAR on a
%Mandrake 9.0 cluster.  If there are problems during the server preparation
%related to C3 or Python2 this may solve the issue.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Install the Python 2 compatibility RPM.  This RPM can be found
%  in the OSCAR distribution package, under the \file{packages/c3/RPMS}
%  directory:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%  # cd oscar-2.3/packages/c3/RPMS
%  # rpm -Uvh python2-compat-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
%\end{verbatim}
%
% (ORIGINALLY in the 8.2 notes)
% TJN: Doc fix for BUG#686916 'xterm needed by SIS'
%      Remove after 2.3 when add to server_prep/pre-req check areas.
%     - on RH7.x systems the xterm binaray is packaged w/ XFree86 (big bundle)
%     - on MDK8.x it showed up in it's own xterm rpm.
%$\item The OSCAR wizard makes use of \cmd{xterm} so this package must be installed.  You can check the RPM database for this package by typing
%  \cmd{rpm -q xterm}.  If \cmd{xterm} is not available, you must
%  install the \file{xterm-165-3mdk.i586.rpm} RPM (you may need Mandrake 
%  CD's to run the \cmd{urpmi} command as mentioned above):
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%  # urpmi xterm
%\end{verbatim}
%
% TJN: relates to server_prep: unmunge_pathenv()
%\item Lastly, \user{root}'s default shell configuration files hardcode the
%  value for the {\tt PATH} environment variable, regardless of what is
%  added via {\tt profile.d/} startup scripts.  This effects various
%  OSCAR installed components, which are installed into locations such
%  as \file{/opt}.  As such, the OSCAR installer appends the global path,
%  e.g., {\tt \$PATH} or {\tt \$\{PATH\}} depending on the shell, to the end
%  of the path so OSCAR installed applications are in the search
%  environment.  This potentially makes changes to the following files:
%
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item \file{/root/.bashrc}
%  \item \file{/root/.cshrc}
%  \item \file{/root/.tcshrc}
%  \end{itemize}
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{IA64 on RHEL 3 Notes}
\label{subsec:ia64notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item In order to use some i386 binaries like tftp-hpa with the emulator, 
  we must modify the \file{/usr\-/lib\-/rpm\-/rpmrc} file. 
  Change the entry: \ \\
    \file{arch\_compat: ia64: noarch} \ \\ 
  to: \ \\
    \file{arch\_compat: ia64: i386 noarch}

\item There is a problem generating a valid initrd files on the nodes, so we 
  must provides one in the image.  After the client image is generated by the 
  oscar wizard (step 4), simply copy a valid initrd in the 
  \file{/boot/efi/efi/redhat}:

  \begin{verbatim}
     cp /boot/efi/efi/redhat/initrd-2.4.21-15.EL.img \
      /var/lib/systemimager/images/oscarimage/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/
  \end{verbatim}

  You will also need to add an INITRD entry to the image
  \file{/etc/systemconfig/systemconfig.conf} file. After the modification, the 
  kernel section should look like this:

  \begin{verbatim}
    [KERNEL0]
        PATH = /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/vmlinuz-2.4.21-15.EL
        INITRD = /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/initrd-2.4.21-15.EL.img
        LABEL = 2.4.21-15.EL
  \end{verbatim}

\item Edit the file \file{/var\-/lib\-/systemimager\-/images\-/oscarimage2\-/etc\-/systemconfig\-/system\-config.conf}
  and add an Hardware section with scsi and network drivers. For the SR870BH2,
  the hardware section of this file will look like this:

  \begin{verbatim}
     [HARDWARE]
        ORDER = e1000 e1000 mptscsih mptbase scsi_mod
  \end{verbatim}

\item If you need to use the keyboard on a usb only system like the Intel 
  SR870BH2, you need to add the usb controller to \file{/etc/modules.conf} 
  of the oscar image. In our image, \file{/etc/modules.conf} cat like this:

  \begin{verbatim}
     [root@rh3as2 etc]# cat modules.conf
     alias usb-controller usb-uhci
  \end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

%jlm - commented this out
%IA64 support was removed for the \oscarversion\ release of OSCAR due to
%timing problems and the significant differences between current IA32
%distributions and the freely available IA64 distributions.  IA64 support is
%fully expected to return in the next release.
%
%TJN: Uncomment when ia64 support returns (and update things!) ;)
%
% \begin{itemize}
% 
% \item The OSCAR auto-install diskette will probably not work on Itanium
%   systems, but they mostly have support for network booting.
%   
% \item Some Itanium 1 or 2 systems are supported by OSCAR under
%   RedHat's Linux 7.2 release for Itanium.  Itanium systems that can
%   use the standard RedHat Itanium kernel for booting and network
%   access should work with OSCAR.
% 
% \item Itanium 2 machines often have newer hardware interfaces for
%       things like networking or disk drives that sometimes require newer
%       kernels than those provided by official Linux distributions. RedHat 7.2
%       will work on some Itanium2 machines. Manufacturers will typically
%       provide driver disks or driver downloads for their machine's newer
%       hardware interfaces. The user will sometimes have to compile their own
%       kernel.  This is essentially a ``do it yourself'' kind
%     of process, and not recommended for novices.  Please consult the
%     OSCAR user's mailing list for more information.
% 
% \item If an Itanium (or an IA32 based) system has new or unknown
%   hardware that is not supported by the stock kernel in the base
%   operating system release, it will not work with standard OSCAR,
%   since OSCAR uses the kernel RPMS supplied with the vendors release
%   to boot and load the compute nodes.  If you have a custom compiled
%   kernel/module set that works for your hardware, you should look at
%   the NCSA Kernel\_Picker utility at \url{http://oscar.ncsa.uiuc.edu/} to
%   enable you to use them in OSCAR.
