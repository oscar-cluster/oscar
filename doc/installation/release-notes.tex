\section{Release Notes}

The following release notes apply to OSCAR version \oscarversion:

\begin{itemize}
\item The documentation is not yet complete.  In particular, the
  installation doc (i.e., this document) needs an overhaul before 1.3
  is finally released.  It has not been updated since 1.2, and
  therefore has many inaccuracies, specific references to RedHat 7.1,
  etc.
  
  Do not despair -- this will definitely happen before 1.3 (final) is
  released.  Until then, bear with us, and send your questions to the
  OSCAR users / development list.
  
\item You {\em must} specify a domain name for your clients when
  defining them.
  
\item The current version of C3 that is shipped with OSCAR requires
  Python 2.x.  The RPMs that are provided are re-built to work on Red
  Hat 7.1 system as well as Red Hat 7.2 system.  However, Red Hat 7.2
  ships with Python 2.x so measures were taken so it will be chosen in
  place of the one provided with OSCAR.  Specifically, we decremented
  the RPM release number.
  
\item Due to some multi-distro issues, we're currently including a
  ``compatibility'' (\file{python2-compat-1.0-1}) RPM to resolve the
  Python2 prerequsite that is slightly different across different
  Linux distributions (also see the file
  \file{packages/c3/RPMS/NOTE.python2}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RedHat 7.2 Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item You will need to update the \rpmname{rpm} RPM to
  \file{rpm-4.0.4-7x} -- the version that ships on the 7.2 CD is
  buggy.  The 4.0.4-7x version is available on the Red Hat updates for
  7.2 (\url{ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.2/en/os/i386/}
  
\item The image build may fail during install, you may need to edit
  file \file{/etc/\-systeminstaller/\-systeminstaller.conf} and change
  the following:

\begin{verbatim}
       pkginstfail=    1
\end{verbatim}

  to

\begin{verbatim}
       pkginstfail=    0
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RedHat 7.3 Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Note that this is not a formally supported distribution.  OSCAR
  \oscarversion has been only somewhat tested on this distribution
  (see Table~\ref{tab:oscar-distro-support}).

\item You may need the same \file{systeminstaller.com} fix as listed
  in the RedHat 7.2 Notes section, above.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandrake 8.2 Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Note that this is not a formally supported distribution.  OSCAR
  \oscarversion has been only somewhat tested on this distribution
  (see Table~\ref{tab:oscar-distro-support}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IA64 Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item \rpmname{pvm} does not currently work on ia64.

\item Itanium 1 is supported.  Itanium 2 is not.  More coming from
  Jeremy on this issue.
\end{itemize}
