\section{What Happens During Client Installation}
\label{app:client-install}

Once the client is network booted, it either boots off the autoinstall
Diskette that you created or uses PXE to network boot.  It then loads
the install kernel.  It then broadcasts a BOOTP/DHCP request to obtain
the IP address associated with its MAC address. The DHCP server
provides the IP information and the client looks for its auto-install
script in \file{/var/lib/systemimager/scripts/}. The script is named
\file{$<$nodename$>$.sh} and is a symbolic link to the script for the
desired image.  The auto-install script is the installation workhorse,
and does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item partitions the disk as specified in the image in
  \file{<imagedir>etc/systemimager/partitionschemes}.
        
\item mounts the newly created partitions on \file{/a}
  
\item chroots to \file{/a} and uses \cmd{rsync} to bring over all the
  files in the image.
  
\item invokes \cmd{systemconfigurator} to customize the image to the
  client's particular hardware and configuration.

\item unmounts \file{/a}
\end{enumerate}

Once clone completes, the client will either reboot, halt, or beep as
specified when defining the image.
