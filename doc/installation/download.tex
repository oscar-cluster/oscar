\section{Downloading an OSCAR Distribution Package}
\label{sec:download}

The OSCAR distribution packages can be downloaded from:

Note that there are actually three flavors of distribution packages
for OSCAR, depending on your bandwidth and installation/development
needs:

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``Regular'': All the OSCAR installation stuff that most users
  need to install and operate an OSCAR cluster.
  
\item ``Extra Crispy'': Same as Regular, except that the SRPMs for
  most of the OSCAR-specific RPMs are also included.  This
  distribution package is significantly larger than Regular, and is
  not necessary for most users -- only those who are interested in
  source RPMs need the Extra Crispy distribution.  The SRPMs can be
  found under \file{packages/*/SRPMS/} directories.
  
\item ``Secret Sauce'': This distribution contains {\em only} the
  SRPMs for OSCAR-specific RPMs in the Regular and Extra Crispy
  distributions (it's essentially (Extra Crispy - Regular)).  It is
  intended only for those who initially downloaded the Regular
  distribution and later decided that they wanted the SRPMs as well.
  The Secret Sauce distribution is intended to be expanded over your
  Regular installation -- it will create \file{packages/*/SRPMS/}
  directories and populate them with the relevant \file{.src.rpm}
  files.
\end{enumerate}

All three distributions can be downloaded from the main OSCAR web
page.
