\section{Downloading an OSCAR Distribution Package}
\label{sec:download}

The OSCAR distribution packages can be downloaded from:

Note that there are actually three flavors of distribution packages
for OSCAR, depending on your bandwidth and installation/development
needs:

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``Regular'': All the OSCAR installation stuff that most users
  need to install and operate an OSCAR cluster.
  
\item ``Extra Crispy'': Same as Regular, except that the SRPMs for
  most of the RPMs in OSCAR are also included.  This distribution
  package is significantly larger than Regular, and is not necessary
  for most users -- only those who are interested in source RPMs need
  the Extra Crispy distribution.  The SRPMs can be found under
  \file{packages/*/SRPMS/} directories.
  
\item ``Secret Sauce'': This distribution contains {\em only} the
  SRPMs for RPMs in OSCAR in the Regular and Extra Crispy
  distributions (it's essentially (Extra Crispy - Regular)).  It is
  intended only for those who initially downloaded the Regular
  distribution and later decided that they wanted the SRPMs as well.
  The Secret Sauce distribution is intended to be expanded over your
  Regular installation -- it will create \file{packages/*/SRPMS/}
  directories and populate them with the relevant \file{.src.rpm}
  files.
\end{enumerate}

All three distributions can be downloaded from the main OSCAR web
page.
