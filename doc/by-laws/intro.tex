\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to document the specific by-laws of
the OSCAR Working Group.  Since the OSCAR Working Group is a
subsidiary of the Open Cluster Group (OCG), the OCG's by-laws also
apply to the OSCAR Working Group.  As such, the OCG's by-laws are the
implicit foundation for the OSCAR by-laws; this document details the
extensions and clarifications of the OCG by-laws that are specific to
the OSCAR Working Group.
