\section{Differences from OCG By-Laws}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Release Managers}

Each major OSCAR version series will have an elected Release Manager
(RM).  The term of the release manager is one year or the life of the
version series, whichever is shorter.  Release Managers can be
re-elected for consecutive terms.

The RM is generally responsible for all issues surrounding the
releases in a given series.  As with all OCG positions, the emphasis
of the entire process is on group consensus.  The Release Manager
should actively strive for group agreement whenever possible.  When
not possible, the Release Manager can make final decisions in order to
make release deadlines.

The RM's responsibilities include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Creating and maintaing a roadmap for each version in the series.
  
\item Creating, maintaining, and enforcing the schedule of all
  releases in the series.

\item Freezing the development tree of a given version in preparation
  for release.

\item Arbitrating all issues relating to a given release.  When the
  group cannot come to consensus on an issue, the RM can call for a
  vote and/or make a final decision.

\item Authorizing a release.
  
\item Ensuring that appropriate press releases are distributed for
  each release.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Core Guests}

An additional membership class is available in the OSCAR working group
-- ``core guests''.  The intent for this class is to allow new members
and/or short-time guests access to the strategic planning sessions of
the core group.

Members of this class are essentially OCG participants with the
following additional attributes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Core guests can attend OSCAR working group meetings /
  teleconferences.
  
\item Core guests can be subscribed to private core e-mail lists.
\end{enumerate}

Core guests have the following critical differences between regular
core membets:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Core guests cannot vote.
  
\item Since OCG groups are ``conensus-driven'' and only vote when
  necessary, ``consensus building'' is essentially informal voting.
  Hence, core guest opinions are not counted when checking for
  consensus.
  
\item Core guest membership only lasts for twelve weeks (three
  months).  
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Core Guest Membership}

Core guests are individually selected by the consensus of the core
group (or a vote, if necessary).  At the end of twelve weeks, each
core guest is automatically reverted to participant status, unless the
core group specifically changes the core guest to another membership
class.
