\section{Differences from OCG By-Laws}

\subsection{Release Managers}

Each major OSCAR version series will have an elected Release Manager
(RM).  The term of the release manager is one year or the life of the
version series, whichever is shorter.  Release Managers can be
re-elected for consecutive terms.

The RM is generally responsible for all issues surrounding the
releases in a given series.  As with all OCG positions, the emphasis
of the entire process is on group consensus.  The Release Manager
should actively strive for group agreement whenever possible.  When
not possible, the Release Manager can make final decisions in order to
make release deadlines.

The RM's responsibilities include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Creating and maintaing a roadmap for each version in the series.
  
\item Creating, maintaining, and enforcing the schedule of all
  releases in the series.

\item Freezing the development tree of a given version in preparation
  for release.

\item Arbitrating all issues relating to a given release.  When the
  group cannot come to consensus on an issue, the RM can call for a
  vote and/or make a final decision.

\item Authorizing a release.
  
\item Ensuring that appropriate press releases are distributed for
  each release.
\end{enumerate}
