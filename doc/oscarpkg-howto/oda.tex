\section{OSCAR Database (ODA)}
\label{sect:oda}

The database used in OSCAR is called ODA.  The information about software
packages and cluster nodes is stored in the database.  There is both a
command-line (\cmd{oda}) and Perl (\file{oda}) interface.  There are several
``shortcuts'' defined to perform queries and mask the underlying data
representation.  The current DB engine is MySQL.  See ODA(1), ODA(3pm).

\begin{verse}
    {\bfseries Notice:} More information should be added to this section.
	However, only a few packages are currently using ODA and are relatively
	sophisticated.
