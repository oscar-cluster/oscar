\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

The Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR) toolkit is used to
install and maintain computing clusters.  The configuration and
installation of software is central to cluster management.  The approached
used in OSCAR is to create a ``package'', which contains the necessary
software as well as additional scripts for configuration on a standard
OSCAR cluster.  This enables software to be added to the installation
framework with as little effort as possible by the package authors.  This
document will describe what comprises an \emph{OSCAR Package} (OPkg),
giving examples from existing OPkgs.  The intent is to provide a single
document for those seeking to create packages for use with the OSCAR
toolkit.
