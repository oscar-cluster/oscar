# This is the main script for the Command Line Installer
# The CLI mirrors the GUI installer by using the same steps only in
# a more scriptable command line version.  This script should not do
# any installation on its own, but should call other scripts to run
# each step.  Doing this will keep the installation process much more
# modular and easier to maintain.
