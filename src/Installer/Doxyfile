#  This file is the default doxygen configuration file for the OSCAR    #
#  Qt Installer. To use it, you must have the following installed:      #
#                                                                       #
# (1) Doxygen  - Comes with RedHat but also available at:               #
#                http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/                  #
# (2) DoxyFilt - A filter for transforming Perl POD documentation into  #
#                doxygen documentation. To get it to work properly:     #
#                (a) Download latest version of DoxyFilt from           #
#                    ftp://ftp.doorways.org/doxyfilt/                   #
#                (b) Untar and then do "perl Makefile.PL; make"         #
#                (c) As root, do "make install"                         #
#                (d) Copy DoxyFilt.pl and DoxyLine.pl to /usr/local/bin #
# (3) Graphviz - (Optional) Contains utility program 'dot' to create    #
#                inheritence diagrams within doxygen documentation.     #
#                Available at:                                          #
#     http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html       #
#                                                                       #
#  When all of the above software is installed, type "doxygen" in this  #
#  directory.  The doxygen documentation will be available in the html  #
#  subdirectory.  Open index.htm with your favorite web browser.        #
#                                                                       #
