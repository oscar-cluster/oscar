This document outlines some rules for the creation of a package set as well as
explains some other parts of the package set.

== Filenames ==

The filename should be a short descriptive name for your package set.  Try not
to make it too general as there will be other package sets as well.
For example, don't call your file packageSet.xml when there will be many others
and there is no way to differentiate.

== Package Set Names ==

The name of your package set should follow this simple rule:

filename (- the extention) + '-' + distro + '-' + arch

This is the name that will be used to identify your set among many others so
it should be unique.

== Version Number ==

This is used so if a package set is updated there will be a way to keep two 
similar package sets apart.  For example, if someone makes a Xen package set
and then someone else changes a version for a single package, there is a
simple way to note that the set has been changed.  The version number will use
the same scheme as the OSCAR packages (the standard Debian way of versioning).

== Repositories ==

Each package can have a repository specified in the XML along with it.  This
repository is not necessarily the one that will be the source of the package,
but it is one that is guaranteed to have the package if none of the other ones
do.  If the package should come from a specific repository, that package should
be renamed or have a specific version attached to it to identify it.
