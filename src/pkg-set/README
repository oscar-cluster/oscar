This document outlines some rules for the creation of a package set as well as
explains some other parts of the package set.

== Filenames ==

The filename should be a short descriptive name for your package set that
includes some other identifying information.  Use this rule to name your
package set:

short_description + '-' + distro + '-' + arch + '.xml'

This makes it easy to find the exact package set desired and matches well with
the name of the package set (described below).

== Package Set Names ==

The name of your package set should be the same as the name of the file
excluding the xml extension.

== Version Number ==

This is used so that when a package set is updated there will be a way to keep
two similar package sets apart.  For example, if someone makes a Xen package set
and then someone else changes a version for a single package, there is a
simple way to note that the set has been changed.  The version number will use
the same scheme as the OSCAR packages (the standard Debian way of versioning).

== Repositories ==

Each package can have a repository specified in the XML along with it.  This
repository is not necessarily the one that will be the source of the package,
but it is one that is guaranteed to have the package if none of the other ones
do.  If the package should come from a specific repository, that package should
be renamed or have a specific version attached to it to identify it.
