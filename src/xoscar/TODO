* Enable the cluster management. It depends on OPM which is not yet available.
* Change the default size, the current one is too big for the normal display 
  configuration.
  Status: basic implementation done; needs testing (does it fit most of the
  display resolutions?).
* Implement a transparent remote OSCAR command execution mechanism that will 
  allow users to use the GUI on their laptop and to give remotely OSCAR.
