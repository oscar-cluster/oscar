* Enable the cluster management. It depends on OPM which is not yet available.
  Sub-tasks:
    - Enable the "-" icons for partition management.
    - Finish the implementation of the "Network Configuration" tab. For a first
      version, we have to:
        * MAC address collection: disable the "Network" and "Manual" options.
        * query the database to get already defined MAC and IP addresses
    - When selected a file with MAC addresses:
        * display them in the "Unassigned MAC Addresses" widget,
        * allow one to assign a MAC address from the "Unassigned MAC Addresses" 
          widget to a node.
    - Find a way to assign IPs (do not know how to do that right now, current it
      is not possible to let users specify them want to use IPs from x.x.x.x to
      x.x.x.x+number_of_nodes).
* Implement a transparent remote OSCAR command execution mechanism that will 
  allow users to use the GUI on their laptop and to give remotely OSCAR.
