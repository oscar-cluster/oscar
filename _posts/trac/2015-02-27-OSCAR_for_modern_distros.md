Development on OSCAR is goin on and port to latest distros is progressing well.
The Unstable version is almost ready for CentOS-7 and Fedora-20. (Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 is also working, but with less features).

As this is an unstable version, there are still things that are not working as expected, and I'm still woking on fixing those last glitches.

If you need to deploy a cluster on CentOS-7, this is the only version that supports it. In that case, be aware that this is an unstable version that still have problems that will need to be fixed by hand.
