We get closer from the release of OSCAR-6.1.0! In order to release OSCAR-6.1.0, the bugs related to OSCAR core must be closed. Lately, many of those tickets have been closed, it is the first time since many years that we have less than 30 open bugs on core (22 while writing those lines).

If you want to follow our progresses, a [report page](http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&component=build+-+SystemConfigurator&component=build+-+SystemImager&component=build+-+SystemInstaller&component=build+-+c3%2Fsc3&component=build+-+other&component=build+-+sync_files%2Fopium&component=core+-+Command+Line+Interface+(CLI)&component=core+-+Database+API+(ODA)&component=core+-+OPD%2FORM&component=core+-+PackMan&component=core+-+Selector&component=core+-+Testing&component=core+-+install&component=core+-+opkgc&component=core+-+other&component=core+-+prereqs&component=core+-+rapt&component=core+-+yume&component=exec+-+switcher&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&type=bug&milestone=Future&report=14) has been open.

Of course, this list can change over time, new tickets may be opened if complete bug reports are submitted on the mailing list.
