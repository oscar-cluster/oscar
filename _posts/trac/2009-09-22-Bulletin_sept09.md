No post has been published since May, mainly because the past few months have been busy. 
A summary of the latest news:
 * We reviewed the roadmap for oscar-6.0.4 so we can include all the patches from different contributors and also the patches we developed to fix reported issues. 
 * We have a new technical chair for the OSCAR-V effort (http://www.csm.ornl.gov/srt/oscarv/): Anand Tikotekar. Anand has been a long term contributor to the project, and was working on the effort since a while. 
 * Finally but not least, we started to work on the preparation of oscar-6.0.4 which should be available early in October.
