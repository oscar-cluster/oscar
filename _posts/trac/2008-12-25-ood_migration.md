Since the latest update of the INRIA forge, where the OSCARonDebian website was hosted, it is not possible to maintain the website in good conditions. Therefore we migrated the OSCARonDebian website on the OSCAR wiki/ [wiki/OSCARonDebian].

We did not migrate all the pages yet but the most important pages have been migrated.
