We have a good news this month: *an new alpha version of OSCAR-5.2, the second one, is available* (note that this is still a snapshot of trunk). This version supports both Debian based systems (i.e., Debian 4.0, ubuntu-7.10, and ubuntu 8.04) and RPM based system (i.e., CentOS-5 i386, CentOS-5 x86_64, RHEL-5 i386, and RHEL-5 x86_64)!

From now, we just need to test this version to be able to release OSCAR-5.2. Also note that this version only includes OSCAR core, OSCAR packages will be included later, following users' needs.

To test this version, report to the following link [http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/wiki/repoTesting]. *We need help for testing*, in order to validate the new version based on different configurations (both hardware and software). If you want to help us, just send your bug report on the oscar-devel mailing list (you do not even need to try to debug OSCAR, just send the raw logs).
