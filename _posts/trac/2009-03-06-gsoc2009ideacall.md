It is time again for mentoring organizations to sign up for this years Google Summer of Code effort.  I am behind the times OSCAR wise and so I don't really have any good ideas for projects, but I am willing to put in applications and remind people about deadlines as I have in past years.

For this too work, we need a good pool of project ideas.  I am putting up an [project idea page](/wiki/gsoc2009ideas/) here.  Please add both short and more thought out project ideas in this space.
