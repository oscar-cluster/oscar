Late bulletin this month, mostly because it was a busy month. We typically have two hot topics this month:
 - OSCAR-6.0.2 is on his way, we are working on the last remaining bugs; we should be able to release OSCAR-6.0.2 within few weeks.
 - A new server is available for the hosting of binary packages repositories. The transition to that server should be transparent for all users.
