OSCAR 6.1.0 has been released!

This release is the first release based on the new architecture and not having known core bugs. For a complete list of modifications, please refer to the [ChangeLog](http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/browser/tags/rel-6-1-0/ChangeLog). The following repositories are already available:

    * debian-5-x86_64 (including Ubuntu 10.04),
    * rhel-5-i386 (including CentOS 5 i386),
    * rhel-5-x86_64 (including CentOS 5 x86_64).

For more information about how to use that version, please refer to the documentation: http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/wiki/InstallGuide

Since the core of OSCAR is now stable, we will focus again on fixing bugs touching third-party software (e.g., Torque), on including new features, and on supporting more Linux distributions.

This is also the first stable release automatically generated using the oscar-packager tool. If you encounter any issue, please contact the development team using the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oscar-users).
