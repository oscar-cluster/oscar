This year again we organize a BoF at [SuperComputing 2009](http://sc09.supercomputing.org/) so the community can meet, speak about latest developments, ongoing work, and future developments.

The BoF is open to everyone, therefore if you are planning of attending SC09, feel free to attend the BoF and give your feedback about OSCAR.
