NOTES:
 * The following SRPMS are be repackaged from Fedora Core 4 (FC4)
   to be used on distributions that do not yet include these RPMS.
       - python-elementtree-1.2.6-4.src.rpm
       - python-twisted-1.3.0-4.src.rpm

 * ZopeInterface is a prerequisite for the Twisted RPM.  
   The source is available at http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface

 * The Twisted RPMS are also being packaged with APItest but are not
   part of APItest proper.
   The sources are available at http://www.twistedmatrix.org

 * The ElementTree RPMS are also being packaged with APItest but are not
   part of APItest proper.
   The sources are available at http://www.effbot.org

 * The ElementTree RPMS are being included here as well as in SSSLib 
   in case APItest is installed but SSSLib is not.
   (Applies to sss-oscar release only.)

 * Note, even if the SRPMs are built as 'noarch' the resulting
   RPMs have the build system's Python version embedded in the
   library path.
