\subsection{APItest}
\label{app:apitest}

The \emph{APItest} tool has been developed as part of the SciDAC: Scalable
System Software (SSS) project to provide a general testing framework.  Tests 
are written in a simple XML format which can include either commands or
embedded scripts (e.g., {\tt /bin/sh}, {\tt/usr/bin/perl}, etc.).  The
framework allows for success/failure tests to be determined by literal or
regular expression matches on the output or by checking return code status.  

These basic tests are grouped together in batches to form more elaborate
tests.  All tests (including test-batches) can express dependencies and the
framework orders them for proper execution.  The results can be viewed from
a basic command-line interface or a graphical web interface.  

For further details see the supplied documentation and the SSS electronic
notebooks at \url{http://www.scidac.org/ScalableSystems}.
