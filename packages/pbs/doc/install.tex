\subsection{The Portable Batch System (PBS) and Maui Scheduler}
\label{app:pbs-overview}

PBS serves as the job launcher and queuing system for OSCAR.  OSCAR
uses the open source version of PBS, OpenPBS.  A commercial version
(PBSPro) exists as well.  OpenPBS includes a basic FIFO scheduler with
it, which is disabled by default in OSCAR.  A more robust, open source
scheduler is enabled instead; called Maui.  In OSCAR 1.3, we are using
OpenPBS version 2.2p11 and Maui 3.06p4.  Both PBS and Maui will be
updated in future OSCAR releases.

Basic PBS functionality is tested by OSCAR's test suite, and is also
used to launch jobs when testing other software included in OSCAR.  If
the PBS test passes, PBS and Maui are up and working.  

If the users of your OSCAR cluster have not used PBS before, you can
expect somewhat of a learning curve.  The OSCAR user's documentation
contains some useful information to get them started.  The user's
document instructs users to ask the system administrator to provide
them with sample PBS scripts used in the OSCAR test suite.  These
scripts can be found in the home directory of the \user{oscartst} user
if the tests have been run previously.
