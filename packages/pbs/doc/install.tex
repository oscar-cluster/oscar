\% Maui scheduler needs to be bolded below

\subsection{The Portable Batch System (PBS)}\label{app:pbs-overview} and Maui
Scheduler

PBS serves as the job launcher and queuing system for OSCAR.  OSCAR uses the
open source version of PBS, OpenPBS.  A commercial version (PBSPro) exists as
well.  OpenPBS includes a basic FIFO scheduler with it, which is disabled by
default in OSCAR.  A more robust open source scheduler is enabled instead;
called Maui.  In OSCAR 1.3, we are using OpenPBS version 2.2p11 and Maui
3.06p4.  Both PBS and Maui will be updated in future OSCAR releases.

PBS is tested by OSCAR's test suite, and is also used to launch jobs when
testing other software included in OSCAR.  If the PBS test passes, PBS and
Maui are up and working.  If the users of your OSCAR cluster have not used PBS
before, you can expect somewhat of a learning curve.  The users' documentation
may contain some useful information to get them started.  The users's document
instructs users to ask the sysadmin to provide them with sample PBS scripts
used in the OSCAR test suite, which can be found in the home directory of
"oscartst" if the tests have been run previously.
