  <description>The Portable Batch System (PBS) is a flexible workload
management system.  It operates on networked, multi-platform UNIX
environments, including heterogeneous clusters of workstations,
supercomputers, and massively parallel systems.

This version of PBS also includes the following patches:
the cplant fr patch to get rid of some hangs because of bad nodes;
the NCSA scaling patch to allow using 500+ nodes;
the NCSA patch to allow home directory spooling;
the NCSA patch to allow compiling on RedHat 7.2;
the ANL rpp tuning patch to minimize packet loss on large clusters;
the NCSA patch to allow .pbs_spool home sub-directory spooling;
the NCSA patch to lock pbs_mom into memory.
the maui_rm_ext patch allows submission with the '-W x=&lt;XSTRING' flag.
the IA64 patch
It simply tells PBS to allow, and opaquely pass the value of the
specified string which Maui then processes.

It has been modified slightly to be usable under the OSCAR cluster
software system.

This base package includes a few core directories necessary for the
Openpbs system.  To make this package useful, you will need to install
one or more of the following related packages: openpbs-oscar-client
includes the client commands and documentation, openpbs-oscar-gui
includes the gui interface to the client commands, openpbs-oscar-mom
includes the software used to run jobs on computation nodes,
openpbs-oscar-server includes the software used to schedule jobs on
the server node.</description>
