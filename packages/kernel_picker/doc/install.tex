\subsection{Selecting a Different Kernel with kernel\_picker}
\label{app:kernel\_picker-overview}

{\bf kernel\_picker} is a Perl script which allows a user to install a given
kernel into an OSCAR image different from the one which is installed by
default.  Prior to building your nodes, you can run {\bf kernel\_picker} to
substitute a given kernel into your OSCAR (SIS) image.  If executed with no
command line options, you will be prompted for all information.  If you use
any command line options, the program will assume that you know what you
are doing and prompt you ONLY for information which is required for
correct execution.

The {\bf kernel\_picker} program assumes that the optional OSCAR image files
you wish to use reside in a subdirectory in the 
{\tt /var/lib/systemimager/images} directory.  By default, the original
OSCAR image is in a subdirectory named {\bf oscarimage}.

{\bf kernel\_picker} is installed in the {\tt /opt/kernel\_picker/bin}
directory.  Documentation is available in HTML, PostScript, PDF, Plain Text,
and manpage formats.  To see the manpage documentation, type the following
at the Unix command prompt:

\begin{verbatim}
  man /opt/kernel_picker/man/man1/kernel_picker.1
\end{verbatim}
