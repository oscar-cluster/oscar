\subsection{Managing machines and images in SIS}
\label{app:troubleshooting-machines-images}

During the life of your cluster, you may want to delete unused
images, create new images, or change the image that a
client uses.  Currently OSCAR doesn't have a direct interface to do
this, but you can use the SIS commands directly. Here are some useful
examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item To list all defined machines, run:
\begin{verbatim}
        mksimachine --List
\end{verbatim}
\item To list all defined images, run:
\begin{verbatim}
        mksiimage --List
\end{verbatim}
\item To delete an image, run:
\begin{verbatim}
        mksiimage --Delete --name <imagename>
\end{verbatim}
\item To change which image a machine will install, run:
\begin{verbatim}
        mksimachine --Update --name <machinename> --image <imagename>
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

There is also a SIS GUI that is availble. Start it by running
\file{tksis}. 

More details on these commands can be obtained from their respective
man pages.

SIS now includes multicast install capability with SystemImager v3.2.x
and Flamethrower v1.0.x.  Working with multicast can prove very
beneficial, especially for large sites.  However, multicast can be a
tricky thing to get working reliably, based on networking equipment,
multicast tuning parameters, machine speed, etc.  If you are interested
in giving multicast a try, see the "HOWTO Use Flamethrower for Multicast
Installs" section in the SystemImager manual (http://www.systemimager.org/documentation/), and please provide us with feedback on your success!
