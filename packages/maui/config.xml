  <description>
Maui is an advanced job scheduler for use on clusters and supercomputers.
It is a highly configurable tool capable of supporting a large array of
fairness policies, dynamic priorities, extensive reservations, and fairshare.
It is currently in use at many of the leading government and academic labs
throughtout the US and around the world.  It is running on machines ranging
from clusters of a few processors to multi-teraflop supercomputers.

This version of Maui has been modified slightly to be usable under the
OSCAR cluster software system.</description>
