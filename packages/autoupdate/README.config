First, make sure you install a config package (autoupdate-cfg-redhat or
autoupdate-cfg-mandrake).  This will put a configuration in place with a
default server and updates directory.

Find a fast server by feeding find_fastest with a bunch of hosts, like
find_fastest ftp.server1.com ftp.server2.edu ftp.server3.tv ftp.server4.org
It will spit out which it could reach the fastest (it uses a simple ping test).
Put the hostname in the appropriate config files in /etc/autoupdate.d/
e.g. if you use redhat, you'll put it in redhat.dld and redhat.get.
You will find a line like  "Host=some.server.com" near the top of the file.
Put the server you chose in so the line reads "Host=ftp.server1.com". 
Near the bottom of the file, there will be a line that reads "Dir=/some/dir".
You will need to specify the path to the updated RPMS on the server in a
particular format.  For more information on how to create this
pathname, see the comments in redhat.dld (or mandrake.dld).  Also look at the
files redhat.serverlist and mandrake.serverlist.

There is also a tool that should work to do this all automatically.  Simply
run /opt/autoupdate/bin/find_fastest and it will do all this for you.
