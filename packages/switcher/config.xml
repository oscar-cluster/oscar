  <description>The env-switcher package provides an convenient method
for users to switch between "similar" packages.  System- and
user-level defaults are maintained in data files and are examined at
shell invocation time to determine how the user's enviornment should
be set up.

The canonical example of where this is helpful is using multiple
implementations of the Message Passing Interface (MPI).  This
typically requires that the user's "dot" files are set appropriately
on each machine that is used since rsh/ssh are typically used to
invoke commands on remote nodes.

The env-switcher package alleviates the need for users to manually
edit their fot files, and instead gives the user commandline control
to switch between multiple implementations of MPI.

While this package was specifically motivated by the use of multiple
MPI implementations on OSCAR clusters, there is nothing specific to
either OSCAR or MPI in env-switcher -- switching between mulitple MPI
implementations is only used in this description as an example.  As
such, it can be used in any environment for any "switching" kind of
purpose.</description>
