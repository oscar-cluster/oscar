# In the post_configure step, it is possible that the server noncore
# RPMs have not been installed yet, hence, the tags that we want to
# set the defaults for may or may not exist yet.  So the functionality
# for setting the tags has been extracted to a common code chunk
# ("set_switcher_defaults") that is invoked both in post_configure
# (invoked immediately after the configurator, mainly to catch when
# people run the OSCAR wizard to change their configuration, but don't
# intend to click on the "Install OSCAR server" button a second time),
# and in post_server_install (to catch the case of the initial
# install, where the tags don't exist yet, but they will after the
# server noncore RPMs are installed).
