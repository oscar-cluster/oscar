# Push the first copy of the system-level switcher settings out to
# the nodes.
#

# It is necessary to push the $sw_file out to all nodes.  Since
# the first time sync_users was run, the default MPI (i.e., switcher
# settings) had already been set, so its checksums will not reflect
# the fact that $sw_file has never been pushed out to the nodes.  So
# use cpush to push it out there (we could sync_users --force, but
# that will sync everything, which seems a little heavy-handed).

sw_file=/opt/env-switcher/etc/switcher.ini

. /etc/profile.d/c3.sh
cpush $sw_file $sw_file

# All done

exit 0
