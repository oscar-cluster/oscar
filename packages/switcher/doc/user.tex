\subsection{An overview of \cmd{switcher}}
\label{app:switcher-overview}

Experience has shown that requiring untrained users to manually edit
their ``dot'' files (e.g., \file{\$HOME/.bashrc},
\file{\$HOME/.login}, \file{\$HOME/.logout}, etc.) can result in
damaged user environments.  Side effects of damaged user environments
include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lost and/or corrupted work
\item Severe frustration / dented furniture
\item Spending large amounts of time debugging ``dot'' files, both by
  the user and the system administrator
\end{itemize}

The OSCAR \cmd{switcher} package is an attempt to provide a simple
mechanism to allow users to manipulate their environment.  The
\cmd{switcher} package provides a convenient command-line interface to
manipulate the inclusion of packages in a user's environment.  Users
are not required to manually edit their ``dot'' files, nor are they
required to know what the inclusion of a given package in the
environment entails.\footnote{Note, however, that it was a requirement
  for the OSCAR \cmd{switcher} package that advanced users should not
  be precluded -- in any way -- from either not using \cmd{switcher},
  or otherwise satisfying their own advanced requirements without
  interference from \cmd{switcher}.}  For example, if a user specifies
that they want LAM/MPI in their environment, \cmd{switcher} will
automatically add the appropriate entries to the \file{\$PATH} and
\file{\$MANPATH} environment variables.

Finally, the OSCAR \cmd{switcher} package provides a two-level set of
defaults: a system-level default and a user-level default.  User-level
defaults (if provided) override corresponding system-level defaults.
This allows a system administrator to (for example) specify which MPI
implementation users should have in their environment by setting the
system-level default.  Specific users, however, may decide that they
want a different implementation in their environment and set their
personal user-level default.

Note, however, that {\em \cmd{switcher} does not change the
  environment of the shell from which it was invoked.}  This is a
critical fact to remember when administrating your personal
environment or the cluster.  While this may seem inconvenient at
first, \cmd{switcher} was specifically designed this way for two
reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If a user inadvertantly damages their environment using
  \cmd{switcher}, there is still [potentially] a shell with an
  undamaged environment (i.e., the one that invoked \cmd{switcher})
  that can be used to fix the problem.
  
\item The \cmd{switcher} package uses the \cmd{modules} package for
  most of the actual environment manipulation (see
  \url{http://modules.sourceforge.net/}).  The \cmd{modules} package
  can be used directly by users (or scripts) who wish to manipulate
  their current environment.
\end{enumerate}

The OSCAR \cmd{switcher} package contains two sub-packages:
\cmd{modules} and \cmd{env-switcher}.  The \cmd{modules} package can
be used by itself (usually for advanced users).  The
\cmd{env-switcher} package provides a persistent \cmd{modules}-based
environment.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The \cmd{modules} package}

The \cmd{modules} package (see \url{http://modules.sourceforge.net/})
provides an elegant solution for individual packages to install (and
uninstall) themselves from the current environment.  Each OSCAR
package can provide a modulefile that will set (or unset) relevant
environment variables, create (or destroy) shell aliases, etc.

An OSCAR-ized \cmd{modules} RPM is installed during the OSCAR
installation process.  Installation of this RPM has the following
notable effects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Every user shell will be setup for modules -- notably, the
  commands ``\cmd{module}'' and ``\cmd{man module}'' will work as
  expected.
  
\item Guarantee the execution of all modulefiles in a specific
  directory for every shell invocation (including corner cases such as
  non-interactive remote shell invocation by \cmd{rsh}/\cmd{ssh}).
\end{itemize}

Most users will not use any \cmd{modules} commands directly -- they
will only use the \cmd{env-switcher} package.  However, the
\cmd{modules} package can be used directly by advanced users (and
scripts).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The \cmd{env-switcher} package}

The \cmd{env-switcher} package provides a persistent
\cmd{modulues}-based environment.  That is, \cmd{env-switcher} ensures
to load a consistent set of modules for each shell invocation
(including corner cases such as non-interactive remote shells via
\cmd{rsh}/\cmd{ssh}).  \cmd{env-switcher} is what allows users to
manipulate their environment by using a simple command line interface
-- not by editing ``dot'' files.

It is important to note that {\em using the \cmd{switcher} command
  alters the environment of all {\bf future} shells / user
  environments.  \cmd{switcher} does not change the environment of the
  shell from which it was invoked.}  This may seem seem inconvenient
at first, but was done deliberately.  See the rationale provided at
the beginning of this section for the reasons why.  If you're really
sure that you know what you're doing, tou can use the
``\cmd{switcher-reload}'' command after changing your switcher
settings via the \cmd{switcher} command.  This will change your
current shell/environment to reflect your most recent switcher
settings.

\cmd{env-switcher} manipulates four different kinds of entities: tags,
attributes, and values.  

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Tags} are used to group similar software packages.  In
  OSCAR, for example, ``mpi'' is a commonly used tag.
  
\item {\em Names} are strings that indicate individual software
  package names in a tag.

\item Each tag can have zero or more {\em attributes}.  
  
\item An attribute, if defined, must have a single {\em value}.  An
  attribute specifies something about a given tag by having an
  assigned value.
\end{itemize}

There are a few built-in attributes with special meanings (any other
attribute will be ignored by \cmd{env-switcher}, and can therefore be
used to cache arbitrary values).  ``default'' is probably the
most-commonly used attribute -- its value specifies which package will
be loaded (as such, its value is always a name).  For example, setting
the ``default'' attribute on the ``mpi'' tag to a given value will
control which MPI implementation is loaded into the environment.

\cmd{env-switcher} operates at two different levels: system-level and
user-level.  The system-level tags, attributes, and values are stored
in a central location.  User-level tags, attributes, and values are
stored in each user's \file{\$HOME} directory.

When \cmd{env-switcher} looks up entity that it manipulates (for
example, to determine the value of the ``default'' attribute on the
``mpi'' tag), it attempts to resolves the value in a specific
sequence:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Look for a ``default'' attribute value on the ``mpi'' tag in
  the user-level defaults
  
\item Look for a ``default'' attribute value on the ``global'' tag in
  the user-level defaults
  
\item Look for a ``default'' attribute value on the ``mpi'' tag in
  the system-level defaults
  
\item Look for a ``default'' attribute value on the ``global'' tag in
  the system-level defaults
\end{enumerate}

In this way, a four-tiered set of defaults can be effected: specific
user-level, general user-level, specific system-level, and general
system-level.  

The most common \cmd{env-switcher} commands that users will invoke
are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \cmd{switcher --list}
  
  List all available tags.

\item \cmd{switcher <tag> --list}
  
  List all defined attributes for the tag \cmd{<tag>}.

\item \cmd{switcher <tag> = <value> [--system]} 
  
  A shortcut nomenclature to set the ``default'' attribute on
  \cmd{<tag>} equal to the value \cmd{<value>}.  If the
  \cmd{--system} parameter is used, the change will affect the
  system-level defaults; otherwise, the user's personal user-level
  defaults are changed.

\item \cmd{switcher <tag> --show}

  Show the all attribute / value pairs for the tag \cmd{<tag>}.  The
  values shown will be for attributes that have a resolvable value
  (using the resolution sequence described above).  Hence, this output
  may vary from user to user for a given \cmd{<tag>} depending on the
  values of user-level defaults.

\item \cmd{switcher <tag> --rm-attr <attr> [--system]} 
  
  Remove the attribute \cmd{<attr>} from a given tag.  If the
  \cmd{--system} parameter is used, the change will affect the system
  level defaults; otherwise, the user's personal user-level defaults
  are used.
  
\end{enumerate}

Section~\ref{app:switcher-which-mpi-to-use} shows an example scenario
using the \cmd{switcher} command detailing how to change which MPI
implementation is used, both at the system-level and user-level.

See the man page for \cmd{switcher(1)} and the output of \cmd{switcher
  --help} for more details on the \cmd{switcher} command.

\subsubsection{Use \cmd{switcher} with care!}

\cmd{switcher} immediately affects the environment of all future shell
invocations (including the environment of scripts).  To get a full
list of options available, read the \cmd{switcher(1)} man page, and/or
run \cmd{switcher --help}.
