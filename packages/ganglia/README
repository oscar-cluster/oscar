This is the Ganglia package for OSCAR Linux clusters.

This tarball should be expanded in the OSCAR distribution tree under
the directory "oscar-<version>/packages/".  After that, you'll have a
directory named oscar-<version>/packages/ganglia/, with all the
Ganglia files in it.

There are some known issues with this release of Ganglia:

- Ganglia may not work reliably on all platforms, and/or may cause
  failures during the OSCAR installation process.  If this is the
  case, simply remove the ganglia package directory from the OSCAR
  tree and re-run the OSCAR installer.

- Sometimes after installation the compute nodes are marked "dead"
  when they are actually available, or after rebooting/adding a node.
  If this occurs, restarting the 'gmond's around the cluster seems
  to resolve the issue, e.g.  'cexec service gmond restart'.

- In some cases, the Ganglia daemon (gmond) seems to spin out of
  control on some nodes and consume large amounts of CPU cycles.
  Running the command "service gmond restart" as root on the affected
  node(s) usually fixes the problem.

- Mandrake 8.2 users need to install the following RPM on the server
  node before running the install_cluster script:

        libpng-1.0.8-2mdk.i586.rpm

  This RPM can be found in the directory packages/ganglia/extras/.
  This RPM is *not* automatically installed by OSCAR.

- After installation, the Ganglia output can be found by pointing your
  web browser to (on the head node):

        http://localhost/ganglia/

- See the Ganglia user-level documentation in the directory:

        packages/ganglia/doc/ganglia-user.pdf
