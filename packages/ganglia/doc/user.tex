\subsection{An overview of \cmd{ganglia}}
\label{app:ganglia-overview}

Ganglia is a real time cluster monitoring tool that uses a protocol
based on XML and XDR across a multicast network to provide a scalable
core tool set.  The cluster monitoring data can be accessed via a web
browser or via the command line (shortly available in OSCAR). The core
Ganglia monitoring toolkit also includes the ability to add user
defined data to the XML streams.

Ganglia was developed at the University of California, Berkeley
Computer Science Division as part of the ongoing clustering research
project named The Millennium Project (and its predecessor The NOW
Project).  It is being developed by Matt Massie
$<$\mailto{massie@cs.berkeley.edu}$>$ and Brent Chun
$<$\mailto{bnc@caltech.edu}$>$. For additional information about the
Ganglia project, see:

\rpmname{ganglia-php-rrd-client} is a package in OSCAR that sets up
the web page display on the head node of the data gathered by the
\rpmname{ganglia-monitor-core}.  This uses \cmd{rrdtool} and the
\rpmname{perl-XML-Parser} packages included with the OSCAR tool suite
as well as the \rpmname{apache}, \rpmname{php}, and \rpmname{expat}
packages installed with the core Linux distribution on the head node
to build an interactive useful display of the XML/XDR data being
passed across the multicast channel.

Once the cluster head node has the OSCAR tools installed a web browser
can be pointed at:

\noindent to see the ganglia web output. If nothing appears, check to
see if \cmd{apache} has been started along with the \cmd{gmond} and
\cmd{ganglia-php-rrd} processes. The startup init scripts can be found
in \file{/etc/init.d/}.

Future versions of OSCAR will also include the \cmd{ganglia} python
command line interface so access to the ganglia XML/XDR data can be
scripted. This will depend on having \rpmname{python} and the
\rpmname{PyXML} packages installed on the head node.

The current version of the Ganglia tools packaged for OSCAR is:

\begin{itemize}
\item \rpmname{ganglia-monitor-core-2.2.3-2oscar}
\item \rpmname{ganglia-php-rrd-client-1.0.4-oscar}
\item \rpmname{perl-XML-Parser-2.30-31}
\item \rpmname{rrdtool-1.0.35-2}
\end{itemize}

There is a newer version of Ganglia that includes a distributed
execution environment but OSCAR already includes the C3 tools that
provides this functionality.  The newer versions of Ganglia with the
distributed execution environment are still being studied for possible
inclusion in future releases of OSCAR.
