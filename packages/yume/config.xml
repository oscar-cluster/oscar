  <description>
  Tool for setting up, exporting yum repositories and executing
yum commands for only these repositories. Use it as high level RPM
replacement which resolves dependencies automatically. This tool
is very useful for clusters. It can:
- prepare an rpm repository
- export it through apache
- execute yum commands applying only to this repository (locally)
- execute yum commands on the cluster nodes applying only to this repository.
This makes installing packages, creating cluster node images, updating
revisions much simpler than with rpm.

          The "yum" package should be installed automatically as dependency.
	  If the distro comes with an own "yum", that one should be installed,
          otherwise "yum-oscar" is taken.
