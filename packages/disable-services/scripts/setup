# Create a post_client_rpm_install script that consists of all the
# disable.* scripts in this directory.  This is necessary because
# post_client_rpm_install runs in the client filesystem, and the
# disable.* scripts will not be there.  So paste them all together
# into a single post_client_rpm_install script to run later.
