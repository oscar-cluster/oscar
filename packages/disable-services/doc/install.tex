\subsection{Disabling Services}

The \cmd{disable-services} OSCAR package disables the following
services on the client nodes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Incoming mail service: the \cmd{sendmail}, \cmd{exim}, and
  \cmd{postfix} daemons are disabled.  This prevents incoming mail
  from being received on the nodes.  Note that outgoing mail is not
  disabled; most outgoing mail is sent immediately.  If there is some
  transient failure and the mail is not sent immediately, it will go
  to the mail service's queue.  A \user{root} crontab is installed
  that runs every hour to trigger the queue in case this happens.

\item Kudzu: the Kudzu service looks for new hardware, usually upon
  boot up.  At boot time, this process takes over 30 seconds.  It is
  disabled in order to speed up the booting of individual nodes.

\end{itemize}

Note that these services are not uninstalled -- they are simply
disabled at boot time.
