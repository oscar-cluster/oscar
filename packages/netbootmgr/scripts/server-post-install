# OL: Code below was a workaround a design flaw in si_netbootmond.
# si_netbootmond parses the rsyncd log which is bad fro 2 reasons:
# 1: can't work with other deployment methods.
# 2: if a node is successfully imaged, that doesn't mean it can boot.
#    setting localboot without knowing if the node was able to reboot is not
#    correct as we will want to image again the node.
#    Instead, si_netbootmond should check the REBOOTED status of the node.

# GV:
# - We do not do restart since we just want to be sure the service restarts 
#   without generating errors. 
# - We do not catch error for stopping (the service may already be stopped and
#   this is just fine.
# - We catch potential errors when starting the service (we want to make sure
#   the service is on)
# Other nasty details: the /etc/init.d/systemimager-server-netbootmond service
# actually rely on /usr/sbin/si_netbootmond which is a very ugly beast: if the
# /etc/systemimager/systemimager-server-rsyncd daemon is not running, 
# everything will fail without a single line of output because the 
# /var/log/systemimager/rsyncd file does not exists. So before to start the
# daemon, we check the rsyncd deamon is running.
