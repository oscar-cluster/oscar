HDF5 is a Hierarchical Data Format product consisting of a data format
specification and a supporting library implementation.

HDF5 includes the following features which make it a widely-used
scientific data format:

\begin{itemize}
\item supports a user-defined hierarchical grouping structure with
  varied datatypes and attributes to organize large and varied data in
  research, development, and production environments,
\item runs on parallel computing platforms using MPI I/O,
\item supports an all-encompassing variety of datatypes, including
  compound and user-defined datatypes,
\item supports very large files (theoretically terabyte and larger,
  though the outer limits have not been tested)
\end{itemize}

HDF5 is fully documented -- see
\file{/opt/hdf5-oscar-1.4.4-post2/doc/hdf5/index.html} for the
documentation that accompanied the release of HDF5 that is installed
with this OSCAR distribution.  For documentation of the current
release of HDF5 as served from the HDF Group's website, see
\url{http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/}.

For further information regarding HDF5, such as lists of current
users, supporting agencies, and applications that employ the library,
see \url{http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/}.

OSCAR installs the HDF5 library at
\file{/opt/hdf5-oscar-1.4.4-post2/lib/}.  Please note that the HDF5
library included in OSCAR is presently only available for the MPICH
implementation of MPI.

\begin{discuss}
  Is this a true statement -- that HDF5 only [currently] supports
  MPICH?  I thought that the HDF5 in OSCAR currently is only compiled
  to run in serial mode...?
  
  I'm pretty sure that I (Jeff) added this statement about MPICH after
  Jeremy wrote the initial docs, so it may not not reflect Jeremy's
  original intent... (hence, this clarification question)
\end{discuss}
