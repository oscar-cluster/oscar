To use pbs_test:

Run without arguments to run in "interactive" mode, where it asks all the necessary
questions.

To run "non-interactively", run with arguments in the following order:

clients to run job on
processors per node
FULL PATH to pbs script (i.e. /home/oscartst/OSCAR_test/shell/pbs_script.shell)
String to be found in output for success (Hello and "Hello" are equivalent)
FULL PATH to output file.  We assume that all have .err and .out extensions, leave them
off
timeout scaling factor
test name

If not specified, the last 3 options (output file, scale, name) will default to the
script name, 3, and "PBS TEST", respectively.
