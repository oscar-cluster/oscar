\subsection{The OSCAR Password Installer and User Management (OPIUM)}
\label{app:opium-overview}

Currently, OPIUM does this by replicating files on a triggered basis.
The user account files are copied to each node on a regular interval.
It is possible to add your own files to this list, by editing the
configuation file \cmd{/opt/opium/etc/sync\_users.conf}.

\paragraph{SSH Configuration}

The OPIUM package also handles the SSH key setup.  This is done by
placing startup scripts in \file{/etc/profile.d} which generate SSH
user key files if they don't exist.  It also generates
\file{authorized\_keys} files which enable users to traverse the
cluster securely without entering passwords.  Since these files reside
in the users' home directories, it is necessary for the home directory
to be mounted on a node in order for a user to \cmd{ssh} to it.  Also,
a user must log on to the head node in order for the keys to be
generated, as the \file{/etc/profile.d} scripts are not installed on
the compute nodes in OSCAR \oscarversion.  SSH1 and SSH2 key files are
supported.
