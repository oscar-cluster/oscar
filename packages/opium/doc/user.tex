\subsection{The OSCAR Password Installer and User Management (OPIUM)}
\label{app:opium-overview}

The OPIUM package includes facilities which synchronize the cluster's
accounts and configures \cmd{ssh} for users.  The user account
synchronization may only be run by root, and is automatically
triggered at regular intervals.
OPIUM configures \cmd{ssh} such that every user can traverse the
cluster securely without entering a password, once logged on to the
head node.  This is done using \cmd{ssh} user keys, in the \file{.ssh}
folder in your home directory.  It is not recommended that you make
changes here unless you know what you are doing.
If you change your password, make sure to change it on the OSCAR head node,
because changes propagate to the cluster nodes from there.
