\subsection{The OSCAR Password Installer and User Management (OPIUM)}
\label{app:opium-overview}

The OPIUM package includes facilities which synchronize the cluster's
accounts and configures \cmd{ssh} for users.  The user account
synchronization may only be run by root, and is automatically
triggered at regular intervals
OPIUM configures \cmd{ssh} such that every user can traverse the
cluster securely without entering a password, once logged on to the
head node.  This is done using \cmd{ssh} user keys, in the \file{.ssh}
folder in your home directory.  It is not recommended that you make
changes here unless you know what you are doing.
