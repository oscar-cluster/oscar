\subsection{The OSCAR Password Installer and User Management (OPIUM)}
\label{app:opium-overview}

The OPIUM package includes facilities which synchronize the cluster's 
accounts and configures ssh for users.  The user account synchronization
may only be run by root, and is automatically triggered each time your
sysadmin adds or removes users or groups.  OPIUM configures ssh such that
every user can traverse the cluster securely without entering a password,
once logged on to the head node.  This is done using ssh user keys, in
the .ssh folder in your home directory.  It is not recommended that you
make changes here unless you know what you are doing.

\paragraph{Caveats (only in OSCAR 1.3):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Your ssh keys are automatically generated the first time you log on to
the OSCAR cluster's head node.  Your first log on must be on the head
node if you wish for your ssh keys to be auto-generated.  This will 
change in OSCAR 1.3.1.
\item \cmd{chsh} and \cmd{passwd} commands will not trigger a synchronization,
so you may have to ask your sysadmin to invoke a sync, or
just wait until the next user is created, which will trigger a sync anyway.
Keeping your password synced shouldn't be as much of an issue anyway, since
ssh makes it so they're not really required.  If synchronization becomes
a troublesome area for you, you may want to ask your sysadmin to add
\cmd{sync_users} to the crontab.
\end{itemize}
