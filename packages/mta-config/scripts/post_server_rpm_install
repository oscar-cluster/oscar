# ADDED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS FOR OSCAR
#

# The configuration options below were added specifically for OSCAR
# for the following purpose:
#
# 1. Allow all nodes in the oscar cluster to access to the oscar_server
# so that the oscar_server can receive the mail in the same domain.
#
# 2. Make all mail from the client nodes have a "From" address that
# looks like it originated from the head node.  This is necessary for
# OSCAR clusters that are private and may have non-public IP names and
# addresses -- some mail servers will reject mail if they have a
# "From" address that is not DNS-resolvable.  Hence, we allow it to
# have a "From" address the same as the OSCAR head node's public IP
# address, which hopefully will be DNS resolvable.  Specifically, mail
# servers receiving mail from the OSCAR server will accept it because
# it can DNS resolve the OSCAR server (etc.).
