Packages should have a config.xml file in their base package
directory. This file will be used to populate the OSCAR database with
information about the package. It can also be used to create database
tables and ODA shortcuts. Here is a minimum config.xml file:

<oscar>
  <name>snargle</name>
  <version>
    <major>A</major>
    <minor>B</minor>
    <subversion>C</subversion>
    <release>D</release>
  </version>         
  <class>third-party</class>
  <summary>installs the snargle utility</summary>
  <license>LICENSE</license>
  <group>GROUP/SUBGROUP</group>
  <description>DESCRIPTION, CAN BE MULTI-LINE WITHIN BLOCK</description>
</oscar>

In the "oscar" database there is a table named "packages" which has a
separate record for each oscar package. All of the tags directly
within the <oscar> block of a package's config.xml file, such as the
ones listed above, will populate that package's record. Some tag names
are special and do other things, these are detailed in later sections
of this document. Tags that are nested two levels deep within the
<oscar> block, are combined with the outer block label. To make this
clear, the above example would result in these fields and values being
stored in the "packages" record for the snargle package:

name -> "snargle"
version_major -> "A"
version_minor -> "A"
version_subversion -> "A"
version_release -> "A"
class -> "third-party"
summary -> "intalls the snargle utility"
description -> "DESCRIPTION, CAN BE MULTI-LINE WITHIN BLOCK"



<oscar>
  <package>
    <database_tables>
      <table1>
        <fields>
          <field1>
            <default> default1 </default>
          </field1>
          <field2>
            <type> integer </type>
            <default> 17 </default>
          </field2>
        </fields>
      </table1>
    </database_tables>
    <snargle>
      <shortcut> test1 expansion1 </shortcut>
    </snargle>

</oscar>

The above config.xml file will set various fields in the packages
database table for the snargle package record. For more complete
examples, see any of the config.xml files included with OSCAR. For
best example of how to create database tables or shortcuts, see the
config.xml file for the oda package. The above example will also
create a database table named package_snargle_table1 with fields named
field1 and field2. The default value for field1 will be "default1",
and field2 will be of type integer with a default value of 17. An ODA
database shortcut will be created with the name
"package_snargle_test1" that expands to "expansion1".
