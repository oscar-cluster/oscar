\subsection{Using LAM/MPI}
\label{app:lam-mpi-overview}

LAM/MPI is a high-quality MPI implementation.... blah blah blah.

\subsubsection{Getting Started with LAM/MPI}

Points to hit:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that switcher is set for LAM/MPI
\item ssh'ing between nodes should already be taken care of by default
  OSCAR setup
\item General scheme (mpicc/mpiCC/mpif77, lamboot, mpirun, [mpirun
  ,]*, lamhalt)
\item mpicc, mpiCC, and mpif77 were all compiled with GNU compilers
\item URL of web site.  Mention FAQ, tutorials, etc.
\end{itemize}
