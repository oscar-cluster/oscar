\subsection{Uninstalling LAM/MPI}
\label{app:lam-mpi-uninstall}

Please note that there is a known bug in the
\file{lam-switcher-modulefile} RPM such that if you use the OSCAR
infrastructure to remove the LAM/MPI package and LAM is set as OSCAR's
default MPI implementation, you will see errors from the switcher
package.  You can clean up these problems by running (as root):

\begin{verbatim}
# switcher mpi = <some_other_mpi_implementation>
\end{verbatim}

Or explicitly state that there is no default OSCAR MPI implementation:

\begin{verbatim}
# switcher mpi = none
\end{verbatim}
