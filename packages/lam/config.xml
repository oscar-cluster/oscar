  <description>This RPM is created specifically for the OSCAR
distribution.  The main difference between this RPM and the official
LAM RPMs distributed by the LAM Team is that it will be installed into
the OSCARPREFIX tree.  Since LAM is the only package installed in
OSCARPREFIX, the man pages and documentation files are installed in
slightly different places as well (the "share" subdirectory is not
really necessary).

LAM (Local Area Multicomputer) is an MPI programming environment and
development system for heterogeneous computers on a network. With
LAM/MPI, a dedicated cluster or an existing network computing
infrastructure can act as a single parallel computer.  LAM/MPI is
considered to be "cluster friendly", in that it offers daemon-based
process startup/control as well as fast client-to-client message
passing protocols.  LAM/MPI can use TCP/IP and/or shared memory for
message passing (currently, different RPMs are supplied for this --
see the main LAM web site for details).

LAM features a full implementation of MPI-1 (with the exception that
LAM does not support cancelling of sends), and much of MPI-2.
Compliant applications are source code portable between LAM/MPI and
any other implementation of MPI.  In addition to providing a
high-quality implementation of the MPI standard, LAM/MPI offers
extensive monitoring capabilities to support debugging.  Monitoring
happens on two levels.  First, LAM/MPI has the hooks to allow a
snapshot of process and message status to be taken at any time during
an application run.  This snapshot includes all aspects of
synchronization plus datatype maps/signatures, communicator group
membership, and message contents (see the XMPI application on the main
LAM web site).  On the second level, the MPI library is instrumented
to produce a cummulative record of communication, which can be
visualized either at runtime or post-mortem.</description>
