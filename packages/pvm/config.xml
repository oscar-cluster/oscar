  <description>PVM is a software system that enables a collection of
heterogeneous computers to be used as a coherent and flexible
concurrent computational resource.

The individual computers may be shared- or local-memory
multiprocessors, vector supercomputers, specialized graphics engines,
or scalar workstations, that may be interconnected by a variety of
networks, such as Ethernet, FDDI.

User programs written in C, C++ or Fortran access PVM through library
routines.</description>
