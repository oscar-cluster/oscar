Notes on building the PVM SRPMS for the various architectures:


[32-bit (x86)]
     # For standard Intel/x86 machines
     # OSCAR is defaulting to i686, change to i386/etc. as needed
   rpmbuild -ba --target=i686 pvm3.spec


[64-bit]
     # For Opteron or EM64T - x86_64 machines
   rpmbuild -ba --target=x86_64 --with linux64  pvm3.spec

     # For Itanium machines
   rpmbuild -ba --target=ia64  --with linux64  pvm3.spec
