\subsection{Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM)}
\label{app:pvm-overview}

Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) is ... \emph{overview stuff-o to be
added here}.


\subsubsection{Using PVM}
\label{app:pvm-usage}

The default OSCAR installation tests PVM via a PBS job (see also:
Section~\ref{app:pbs-overview} on page~\pageref{app:pbs-overview}).
However, some users may choose to use PVM outside of this context so a
few words on usage may be helpful~\footnote{Note, the examples in this
  section assume a shared filesystem, as is used with OSCAR.}.

The default location for user executables is
\file{\$HOME/pvm3/bin/\$PVM\_ARCH}.  On an IA-32 Linux machine, this
is typically of the form: \file{/home/sgrundy/pvm3/bin/LINUX} (replace
``\file{LINUX}'' with ``\file{LINUX64}'' on IA-64).  This is where
binaries should be placed so that PVM can locate them when attempting
to spawn tasks.  This is detailed in the \file{pvm\_intro(1PVM)}
manual page when discussing the environment variables \file{PVM\_PATH}
and \file{PVM\_WD}.

The ``hello world'' example shipped with PVM demonstrates how one can
compile and run a simple application outside of PBS.  The following
screen log highlights this for a standard user \emph{sgrundy} (Solomon
Grundy).

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
    # Crate default directory for PVM binaries (one time operation)
  sgrundy: $ mkdir -p $HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH

    # Copy examples to local 'hello' directory
  sgrundy: $ cp $PVM_ROOT/examples/hello*  $HOME/hello-example
  sgrundy: $ cd $HOME/hello-example

    # Compile a hello world, using necessary include (-I) and library
    # (-L) search path info as well as the PVM3 lib.
  sgrundy: $ gcc -I$PVM_ROOT/include  hello.c -L$PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH  \
  > -lpvm3  -o hello
  sgrundy: $ gcc -I$PVM_ROOT/include  hello_other.c -L$PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH \
  > -lpvm3  -o hello_other

    # Move the companion that will be spawned to the default 
    # PVM searchable directory
  sgrundy: mv hello_other $HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\noindent At this point you can start PVM, add hosts to the virtual
machine and run the application:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
    # Start PVM and add one host "oscarnode1".
  sgrundy: $ pvm
  pvm> add oscarnode1
  add oscarnode1
  1 successful
                     HOST    DTID
               oscarnode1   80000
  pvm> quit
  quit

  Console: exit handler called
  pvmd still running.
  sgrundy: $

    # Run master portion of hello world which contacts the companion.
  sgrundy: $ ./hello
  i'm t40005
  from t80002: hello, world from oscarnode1.localdomain

    # Return to the PVM console and terminate ('halt') the virtual machine.
  sgrundy: $
  sgrundy: $ pvm
  pvmd already running
  pvm> halt
  halt
  Terminated
  sgrundy: $
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

An alternate method is to use options in the hostfile supplied to
\cmd{pvm} when started from the command-line.  The advantage to the
hostfile options is that you don't have to place your binaries in the
default location or edit any ``.dot'' files.  You can compile and run
the ``hello world'' example in this fashion by using a simple hostfile
as shown here.  

The example below uses the same ``hello world'' program that was
previously compiled, but using a hostfile with the appropriate options
to override the default execution and working directory.  Remember
that the ``\cmd{hello}'' program exists in the
\file{/home/sgrundy/hello-example} directory:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
  sgrumpy: $ cat myhostfile
  *   ep=/home/sgrundy/hello-example  wd=/home/sgrundy/hello-example
  oscarnode1
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\noindent The options used here are: 
\begin{quote}
  \begin{description}
  \item[{\tt *}] -- any node can connect
  \item[{\tt ep}] -- execution path, here set to local directory
  \item[{\tt wd}] -- working directory, here set to local directory
  \item[\emph{nodes}] -- a list of nodes, one per line
  \end{description}
\end{quote}

\noindent Now, we can startup \cmd{pvm} using this \file{myhostfile}
and run the \file{hello} application once again.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
   # Now, we just pass this as an argument to PVM upon startup.
  sgrundy: $ pvm myhostfile
  pvm> quit
  quit
  
  Console: exit handler called
  pvmd still running.

   # The rest is the same as the previous example
  sgrundy: $ ./hello
  i'm t40005
  from t80002: hello, world from oscarnode1.localdomain

  sgrundy: $ pvm
  pvmd already running
  pvm> halt
  halt
  Terminated
  sgrundy: $
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsubsection{Other details}

The OSCAR installation of PVM makes use of the \file{env-switcher}
package (also see Section~\ref{app:switcher-overview},
page~\pageref{app:switcher-overview}).  This is where the system-wide
\verb=$PVM_ROOT, $PVM_ARCH= and \verb=$PVM_RSH= environment variable
defaults are set.  Traditionally, this material was included in each
user's ``.dot'' files to ensure availability with non-interactive
shells (e.g. \cmd{rsh}/\cmd{ssh}).  Through the \file{env-ewitcher}
package, a user can avoid any ``.dot'' file adjustments by using the
hostfile directive or default paths for binaries as outlined in the
Usage Section~\ref{app:pvm-usage}.
