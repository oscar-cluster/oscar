\subsection{Sun Grid Engine}
\label{app:sge}

The following is an overview about Sun Grid Engine which is taken from
the official website at \url{http://gridengine.sunsource.net}:

``The Grid Engine project is an open source community effort to facilitate the adoption of distributed computing solutions. Sponsored by Sun Microsystems and hosted by CollabNet, the Grid Engine project provides enabling distributed resource management software for wide ranging requirements from compute farms to grid computing.'' 

``The Grid Engine project is about expanding the application and use of distributed computing. We want to:  

--- Advance Grid Engine technology  \\
--- Establish community-driven standards for distributed computing  \\
--- Enable developers to create innovative services and applications across distributed heterogeneous compute environments ''

SGE is an included package in OSCAR and it is recommended that you select it to be installed since it acts as a comprehensive resource manager and effectively schedules youe batch jobs. Also, you can setup custom job queues, customize and prioritize users/jobs using SGE tools.

As an added benefit, most of SGE installation and startup are automated. Only minimal configuration, if any, is required.
