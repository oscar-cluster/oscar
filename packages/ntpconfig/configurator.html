    </center>
    <p>
      By default, if you do not configure the ntpconfig package, your
      cluster will be set up such that your nodes will be able to use the
      headnode as a time server.  If you select a NTP server to sync up,
      please make sure that you do have a network connection to the server
      (whether it is on your LAN or on the Internet).  The default,
      pool.ntp.org is a known good NTP servers pool provided by ntp.org.
    </p>
    <p>
      NTP server entered below is for head node. In any case, cluster
      nodes will use headnode as NTP server.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is the first time for you to configure the ntpconfig package,
      hitting Cancel now will setup your headnode to act as a time server
      for your nodes.
