<H1>Select NTP Servers</H1>
</CENTER>
The ntpconfig package sets up ntp (the Network Time Protocol) on your
cluster so that all of your machines will be synchronized to the same time.
However, we also would like the OSCAR server node's time to be synchronized
with the rest of the world.  In order to do that, we need to specify at
least one public NTP server to which we can connect.
<P>
Below are three public NTP servers that should work just fine for most
people.  However, you can select/deselect these servers as you like.  You
can also add other servers to the list in the text box below.  In the text
box, enter one server per line.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>You must have at least one NTP server selected/entered or by
default you get the three general use public NTP servers below.
