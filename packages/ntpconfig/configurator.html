<h1>Configuring ntpconfig</h1>
</center>
<p>
By default, if you do not configure the ntpconfig package, your cluster will be set up such that your
nodes will be able to use the headnode as a time server.  If you select a NTP server to sync up, please make sure
that you do have a network connection to the server (whether it is on your LAN or on the Internet).  The default, 
pool.ntp.org is a known good NTP servers pool provided by ntp.org.
</p>
<p>
If this is the first time for you to configure the ntpconfig package, hitting Cancel now will setup your headnode to act as a time server for your nodes.
