Data Files for Persistence

In general, all data files consist of newline ("\n") delimited records.
Each record in turn is delimited by a ":" character (these choices are
arbitrary and can easily be changed). All fields in a record are 
single-valued (ie normalized). If the value of a field cantains the
record separator character, it must be escaped using the " character
(see the adapter file).

- syntax
  Describes the schema in all subsequent files. Fields are
  defined as follows:

  syntax     the syntax to use for subsequent access
  tabname    a table (ie file)
  colname    a column (ie field) in that file
  colseq     the order of the column
  iskey      1=column participates in a PRIMARY key
