# The syntax of this file is very simple:
# - the file is composed of blocks, representing different OSCAR release (for
#   instance unstable for trunk, 5.0 for OSCAR-5.0). The version number has to
#   match the version specified in the VERSION file.
# - for each supported distros for a specific OSCAR release, an entry has to 
#   exist in the associated block
# - each distro entry is as following:
#   DISTRO-ID default-distro-repo default-oscar-repo
#   where: DISTRO-ID is the distribution id using the OS_Detect syntax
#          default repository URLs have to follow the rapt/yume syntax
